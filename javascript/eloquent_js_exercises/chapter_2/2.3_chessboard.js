/*
 * Chessboard 
 * Write a program that creates a string that 
 * represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters 
 * to separate lines. At each position of the grid 
 * there is either a space or a "#" character. 
 * The characters should form a chessboard. Passing 
 * this string to console.log should show something 
 * like this:
 *  # # # #
 * # # # #
 *  # # # #
 * # # # #
 *  # # # #
 * # # # #
 *  # # # #
 * # # # #
 * When you have a program that generates this pattern,
 * define a binding size = 8 and change the program so
 * that it works for any size, outputting a grid of 
 * the given width and height.
