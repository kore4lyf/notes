# Cryptocurrency Investment Bible

- The more money exists, the cheaper it becomes.



- Let’s sort out how the mining works. When, for example, you send money from your wallet to another person's wallet, your transactions fall into the so-called "mempool." 



- The Bitcoin mempool is a collection of all transactions waiting to receive a network confirmation. Miners, guided by their own principles, collect transactions in specific blocks and then try to insert them in the Blockchain. Every block in the Blockchain generates every ten minutes.



- The Proof of Work protocol confirms that a miner does a huge amount of work to find a correct nonce and get a successful hash. You should spend much time to find the needed one. I'll explain in more detail.



- The block difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks and depends on how many zeros are at the beginning of a particular hash. It is not difficult to find the hash itself, but it takes pains to find a successful hash with a certain number of zeros.



- You can’t point to a physical object, digital file, or piece of code and say, “this is a Bitcoin.” Instead, the entire Bitcoin network is only a series of transaction records. Every transaction in the history of Bitcoin lives in the Bitcoin Blockchain’s distributed ledger.

## Cryptocurrency Exchanges 
- (Poloniex)[https://poloniex.com] - Cryptocurrency exchange.



- (Kraken)[https://www.kraken.com/] is a large European cryptocurrency exchange with a huge trade volume. I consider Kraken to be the fastest and most user-friendly platform.



- (Bitfinex)[https://www.bitfinex.com/?locale=en] is a popular Hong Kong cryptocurrency exchange. It offers a few more tools than other exchanges and has a more sophisticated design.



- (Bittrex)[https://bittrex.com/] differs from others as it is the so-called altcoin exchange. Virtually every new coin or token is available here. You can even trade small-cap coins. Their prices are usually "pumped up," which means they skyrocket and then plummet. It is good for you if you are a trader. I regard this exchange as one of the safest.






# SAFE AND RELIABLE DIGITAL CURRENCY
- (Localcoins)[https://localbitcoins.com/] Here you will find people who are willing to meet with you and make and exchange for cash or by bank transfer.

A reliable DCE should have a website a ratings and reviews section, support chat, and the amounts of currency available for conversion. For example, you can see that this DCE offers a particular amount of Bitcoin, Ether, and cash dollars.
Another good characteristic of digital currency exchanges is the possibility to reserve the price of a currency for a certain period.
