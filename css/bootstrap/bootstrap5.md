# Bootstrap 5
- Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development
- Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins
- Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs


## Bootstrap Versions
The main differences between Bootstrap 5 and Bootstrap 3 & 4, is that Bootstrap 5 has switched to vanilla JavaScript instead of jQuery.




## Why Use Bootstrap?
Advantages of Bootstrap:
- Easy to use
- Mobile-first approach
- Responsive features: Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets, and desktops
- Browser compatibility: Bootstrap 5 is compatible with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera). Note that if you need support for IE11 and down, you must use either BS4 or BS3.




## Bootstrap Containers
Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents.

Containers are used to pad the content inside of them, and there are two container classes available:
- The `.container` class provides a responsive fixed width container
- The ``.container-fluid` class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport


### Fixed Container
Use the `.container` class to create a responsive, fixed-width container.

Note that its width (max-width) will change on different screen sizes:

- Extra small < 576px	- 100%
- Small ≥ 576px	- 540px
- Medium ≥ 768px	- 720px
- Large ≥ 992px	- 960px
- Extra Large ≥ 1200px	- 1140px
- XXL ≥ 1400px - 1320px



### Fluid Container
Use the `.container-fluid` class to create a full width container, that will always span the entire width of the screen (width is always 100%):
