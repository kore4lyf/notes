The Obstacle is the way by Raun Holiday

- Obstacles are not only to be expected but embraced.

1. PERCEPTION
-THE DISCIPLINE OF PERCEPTION-
- "He was inclined to see the opportunity in every disaster. To that we could add: He had the strength to temptation or excitement, no matter how seductive, no matter the situation" - John D. Rockefeller 
- You will come across obstacles in life-fair and unfair. And you will discover, time and time again, that what matters most is not what these obstacles are but how we see them, how we react to them, and whether we keep our composure. You will learn that this reaction determines how successful we will be in overcoming-or possibly thriving because of them.
- There are a few things to keep in mind when faced with a seemingly insurmountable obstacle. We must try:

* To be objective
* To control emotions and keep an even keel
* To choose to see the good in a situation
* To steady our nerves
* To ignore what disturbs or limits others
* To place things in perspective
* To revert to the present moment
* To focus on what can be controlled

This is how you see the opportunity within the obstacle. It does not happen on
its own. It is a process-one that results from self-discipline and logic.
And that logic is available to you. You just need to deploy it.

- RECOGNIZE YOUR POWER -
- we are never completely powerless.
- Choose to see each situation for what it could be, accompanied by hard work and a little upbeat spirit.

- STEADY YOUR NERVE -
- "What such a man needs is not courage but nerve control, cool headedness. This he can get only by practice." -THEODORE ROOSEVELT
- Nerve is a matter of defiance and control.
- Don't forget, there are always people out there looking to get you. They want to intimidate you. Rattle you. Pressure you into making a decision before you've gotten all the facts. They want you thinking and acting on their terms, not yours.
So the question is, are you going to let them? When we aim high, pressure and stress obligingly come along for the ride. Stuff is going to happen that catches us off guard, threatens or scares us. Surprises (unpleasant ones, mostly) are almost guaranteed. The risk of being overwhelmed is always there.
Steady your nerve do let them define you, patience and control is see you through.

- CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS -
- Would you have a great empire? Rule over yourself. -PUBLIUS SYRUS
- When people panic, they make mistakes. 
- 

- PRACTICE OBJECTIVITY -
Don't let the force of an impression when it first hit you knock you off your feet;just say to it: Hold on a moment; let me see who you are and what you represent. Let me put you to the test.-EPICTETUS
- The perceiving eye is weak, he wrote; the observing eye is strong.

LOVE EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS: AMOR FATI
My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing
to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear
what is necessary, still less conceal it . . . but love it.
-NIETZSCHE
