## EVERY DAY IS GROUND HOG DAY

### TAKE A DAY AT A TIME
-  Groundhog Day: Yesterday’s over, tomorrow may never come, there’s just today and what you can do with it. 

- Any man can fight the battles of just one day. It is only when you and I add the burden of those two awful eternities, yesterday and tomorrow, that we break down. It is not the experience of today that drives men mad. It is remorse or bitterness for something which happened yesterday or the dread of what tomorrow may bring. Let us therefore do our best to live but one day at a time.
