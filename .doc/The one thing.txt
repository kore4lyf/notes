THE ONE THING by GARY KELLER & JAY PAPASAN
The surprisingly simple truth behind extraordinary results.

- IF YOU CHASE TWO RABBITS, YOU WILL NOT CATCH EITHER ONE. - RUSSIAN PROVERB
- "Success is simple. Do what's right, the right way, at the right time." -Arnold H. Glasow 
- Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw offthe bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover." -Mark Twain

1. The ONE Thing
- "Be like a postage stamp- stick to one thing until you get there." -Josh Billings
- Where I'd had huge success, I had narrowed my concentration to one thing, and where my success varied, my focus had too.
- Extraordinary results are directly determined by how narrow you can make your focus.
- The way to get the most out of your work and your life is to go as small as possible. Big success comes when we do a few things well.
- You need to be doing fewer things for more effect instead of doing more things with side effects.

2. The Domino Effect
- A single domino is capable of bringing down another domino that is actually 50 percent larger.
- When you think about success, shoot for the moon. The moon is reachable if you prioritize everything and put all of your energy into accomplishing the most important thing. 
- Getting extraordinary results is all about creating a domino effect in your life. 
- You do the right thing and then you do the next right thing. Over time it adds up.
- When you see someone who has a lot of knowledge, they learned it over time. When you see someone who has a lot of skills, they developed them over time. When you see someone who has done a lot, they accomplished it over time. When you see someone who has a lot of money, they earned it over time. The key is over time. Success is built sequentially. It's one thing at a time.

3. Success Leaves Clues
- Extraordinarily successful companies always have one product or service they're most known for or that makes them the most money.
- Technological innovations, cultural shifts, and competitive forces will often dictate that a business's ONE Thing evolve or transform. Apple is a study in creating an environment where an extraordinary ONE Thing can exist while transitioning to another extraordinary ONE Thing. 
- "There can only be one most important thing. Many things may be important, but only one can be the most important." -Ross Garber
- There is always one person: No one is self-made. There is always one person that will help u get to see ur destination.
- Everyone has one person who either means the most to them or was the first to influence, train, or manage them.
- "You must be single-minded. Drive for the one thing on which you have decided."-General George S. Patton
- "Success demands singleness of purpose." - Vince Lombardi

PART 1
THE LIES
1. Everything Matters Equally
2. Multitasking
3. A Disciplined Life
4. Willpower Is Always on Will-Call
5. A Balanced Life
6. Big Is Bad


Everything Matters Equally
- Equality is a lie.
- Achievers always work from a clear sense of priority.
- The majority of what you want will come from the minority of what you do.
- A to-do list can easily lead you astray. A to-do list is simply the things you think you need to do; the first thing on your list is just the first thing you thought of. To-do lists inherently lack the intent of success. 
- Instead of a to-do list, you need a success list-a list that is purposefully created around extraordinary results.
- To-do lists tend to be long; success lists are short. One pulls you in all directions; the other aims you in a specific direction. One is a disorganized directory and the other is an organized directive. 

1. Go small. Don't focus on being busy; focus on being productive. Allow what matters most to drive your day.
2. Go extreme. Once you've figured out what actually matters, keep asking what matters most until there is only one thing left. That core activity goes at the top of your success list.
3. Say no. Whether you say "later" or "never," the point is to say "not now" to anything else you could do until your most important work is done.
4. Don't get trapped in the "check off" game. If we believe things don't matter equally, we must act accordingly. We can't fall prey to the notion that everything has to be done, that checking things off our list is what success is all about. We can't be trapped in a game of "check off" that never produces a winner. The truth is that things don't matter equally and success is found in doing what matters most.

Sometimes it's the first thing you do. Sometimes it's the only thing you do. Regardless, doing the most important thing is always the most important thing.


Multitasking
- If doing the most important thing is the most important thing, why would you try to do anything else at the same time? 
- Multitasking is a lie.
- Multitasking is neither efficient nor effective. 
- "Multitasking is merely the opportunity to screw up more than one thing at a time." -Steve Uzzell
- Multitasking doesn't save time -it wastes time.
- But here's the catch: you're not really focused on both activities. One is happening in the foreground and the other in the background. 
-  You can do two things at once, but you can't focus effectively on two things at once. 
- Focus occurs-in the prefrontal cortex.

1. Distraction is natural. Don't feel bad when you get distracted. Everyone gets distracted.
2. Multitasking takes a toll. At home or at work, distractions lead to poor choices, painful mistakes, and unnecessary stress.
3. Distraction undermines results. When you try to do too much at once, you can end up doing nothing well. 
Figure out what matters most in the moment and give it your undivided attention. In order to be able to put the principle of The ONE Tdhing to work, you can't buy into the lie that trying to do two things at once is a good idea. Though multitasking is sometimes possible, it's never possible to do it effectively.


A Disciplined Life
- Success is about doing the right thing, not about doing everything right.
- The trick to success is to choose the right habit and bring just enough discipline to establish it. 
- Use discipline to form an habit.
- Put up with the discipline long enough to turn it into a habit, and the journey feels different. Over time, the habit you're after becomes easier and easier to sustain. 
- Lock in one habit so it becomes part of your life.
- It takes an average of 66 days to acquire a new habit. The full range was 18 to 254 days, but the 66 days represented a sweet spot-with easier behaviors taking fewer days on average and tough ones taking longer.
1. Don't be a disciplined person. Be a person of powerful habits and use selected discipline to develop them.
2. Build one habit at a time. Success is sequential, not simultaneous. No one actually has the discipline to acquire more than one powerful new habit at a time. Super-successful people aren't superhuman at all; they've just used selected discipline to develop a few significant habits. One at a time. Over time.
3. Give each habit enough time. Stick with the discipline long enough for it to become routine. Habits, on average, take 66 days to form. Once a habit is solidly established, you can either build on that habit or, if appropriate, build another one. If you are what you repeatedly do, then achievement isn't an action you take but a habit you forge into your life. You don't have to seek out success. Harness the power of selected discipline to build the right habit, and extraordinary results will find you.


Willpower Is Always on Will-Call
- Willpower has a limited battery life but can be recharged with some downtime. 
- Just as with "the early bird gets the worm" and "make hay while the sun shines," willpower is a timing issue.
- Limited resources must be managed, yet we fail to recognize that willpower is one of them. We act as though our supply of willpower were endless. 
- A tiny extra cognitive load is enough to prevent a prudent choice. The more we use our mind, the less minding power we have.
- Foods that elevate blood sugar evenly over long periods, like complex carbohydrates and proteins, become the fuel of choice for high-achievers-literal proof that "you are what you eat."
- If you want to get the most out of your day, do your most important work-your ONE Thing-early.

1. Don't spread your willpower too thin. On any given day, you have a limited supply of willpower, so decide what matters and reserve your willpower for it.
2. Monitor your fuel gauge. Full-strength willpower requires a full tank. Never let what matters most be compromised simply because your brain was under-fueled. Eat right and regularly.
3. Time your task. Do what matters most first each day when your willpower is strongest. Maximum strength willpower means maximum success. Don't fight your willpower. Build your days around how it works and let it do its part to build your life. Willpower may not be on willcall, but when you use it first on what matters most, you can always count on it.


A Balanced Life
- Nothing ever achieves absolute balance.
- The problem with living in the middle is that it prevents you from making extraordinary time commitments to anything. In your effort to attend to all things, everything gets shortchanged and nothing gets its due.
- The reason we shouldn't pursue balance is that the magic never happens in the middle; magic happens at the extremes. chasing the extremes presents real challenges.
- When you gamble with your time, you may be placing a bet you can't cover.  So if achieving balance is a lie, then what do you do? Counterbalance.
-  Even if you're sure you can win, Toying with time will lead you down a rabbit hole with no way out.
- When you change your language from balancing to prioritizing, you see your choices more clearly and open the door to changing your destiny. 
- When you're supposed to be working, work, and when you're supposed to be playing, play. It's a weird tightrope you're walking, but it's only when you get your priorities mixed up that things fall apart.
1. Think about two balancing buckets. Separate your work life and personal life into two distinct buckets-not to compartmentalize them, just for counterbalancing. Each has its own counterbalancing goals and approaches.
2. Counterbalance your work bucket. View work as involving a skill or knowledge that must be mastered. This will cause you to give disproportionate time to your ONE Thing and will throw the rest of your work day, week, month, and year continually out of balance. Your work life is divided into two distinct areas-what matters most and everything else. You will have to take what matters to the extremes and be okay with what happens to the rest. Professional success requires it.
3. Counterbalance your personal life bucket. Acknowledge that your life actually has multiple areas and that each requires a minimum of attention for you to feel that you "have a life." Drop any one and you will feel the effects. This requires constant awareness. You must never go too long or too far without counterbalancing them so that they are all active areas of your life. Your personal life requires it. Start leading a counterbalanced life. Let the right things take precedence when they should and get to the rest when you can. An extraordinary life is a counterbalancing act


Big Is Bad

1. Think big. Avoid incremental thinking that simply asks, "What do I do next?" This is at best the slow lane to success and, at worst, the off ramp. Ask bigger questions. A good rule of thumb is to double down everywhere in your life. If your goal is ten, ask the question: "How can I reach 20?" Set a goal so far above what you want that you'll be building a plan that practically guarantees your original goal.
2. Don't order from the menu. Apple's celebrated 1997 "Think Different" ad campaign featured icons like Ali, Dylan, Einstein, Hitchcock, Picasso, Gandhi, and others who "saw things differently" and who went on to transform the world we know. The point was that they didn't choose from the available options; they imagined outcomes that no one else had. They ignored the menu and ordered their own creations. As the ad reminds us, "People who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the only ones who do."
3. Act bold. Big thoughts go nowhere without bold action. Once you've asked a big question, pause to imagine what life looks like with the answer. If you still can't imagine it, go study people who have already achieved it. What are the models, systems, habits, and relationships of other people who have found the answer? As much as we'd like to believe we're all different, what consistently works for others will almost always work for us.
4. Don't fear failure. It's as much a part of your journey to extraordinary results as success. Adopt a growth mindset, and don't be afraid of where it can take you. Extraordinary results aren't built solely on extraordinary results. They're built on failure too. In fact, it would be accurate to say that we fail our way to success. When we fail, we stop, ask what we need to do to succeed, learn from our mistakes, and grow. Don't be afraid to fail. See it as part of your learning process and keep striving for your true potential. Don't let small thinking cut your life down to size. Think big, aim high, act bold. And see just how big you can blow up your life.



PART2
THE TRUTH - THE SIMPLE PATH TO PRODUCTIVITY
- I learned that success comes down to this: being appropriate in the moments of your life. If you can honestly say, "This is where I'm meant to be right now, doing exactly what I'm doing," then all the amazing possibilities for your life become possible.
- 

10. The Focusing Question
- 
- The secret of getting ahead is getting started. The secret to getting started is breaking your complex overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks and then starting on the first one.
- To stay on track for the best possible day month, year, or career, you must keep asking the Focusing Question. Ask it again and again, and it forces you to line up tasks in their levered order of importance
- Answers come from questions, and the quality of any answer is directly determined by the quality of the question. 
1. Great questions are the path to great answers. The Focusing Question is a great question designed to find a great answer. It will help you find the first domino for your job, your business, or any other area in which you want to achieve extraordinary results.
2. The Focusing Question is a double-duty question. It comes in two forms: big picture and small focus. One is about finding the right direction in life and the other is about finding the right action.
3. The Big-Picture Question: "What's my ONE Thing?" Use it to develop a vision for your life and the direction for your career or company; it is your strategic compass. It also works when considering what you want to master, what you want to give to others and your community, and how you want to be remembered. It keeps your relationships with friends, family, and colleagues in perspective and your daily actions on track.
4. The Small-Focus Question: "What's my ONE Thing right now?" Use this when you first wake up and throughout the day. It keeps you focused on your most important work and, whenever you need it, helps you find the "levered action" or first domino in any activity. The small-focus question prepares you for the most productive workweek possible. It's effective in your personal life too, keeping you attentive to your most important immediate needs, as well as those of the most important people in your life.
Extraordinary results come from asking the Focusing Question. It's how you'll plot your course through life and business, and how you'll make the best progress on your most important work. Whether you seek answers big or small, asking the Focusing Question is the ultimate success habit for your life.

11. The Success Habit
- "Success is simple. Do what's right, the right way, at the right time." -Arnold H. Glasow
- Habits can be hard to break-and hard to create. 
The Focusing Question is the most powerful success habit we can have.
1. Understand and believe it.
2. Use it. Ask yourself the Focusing Question.
3. Make a habit.
4.Leverage reminders. Set up ways to remind yourself to use the Focusing
Question. 

12. The Path to Great Answers
- "People do not decide their futures, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures." -F. M. Alexander
- You ask a great question, then you seek out a great answer. 
- Let your focus question be big and specific e.g How can I increase double sale this month. 
Small and specific - is not always challenging, low goals don't lead to extraordinary actions so they rarely lead to extraordinary results. E.g. "What can I do to increase sales by 5 percent this year?"
Small and broad - e.g. "What can I do to increase sales?" This is not really an achievement question at all. It's more of a brainstorming question.
Big & Broad - "What can I do to double sales?". But questions lack Specification in time, because the solution to this problem will vary with respect to the time it needs to be achieved.
Big & Specific - "What can I do to double sales in six months?"Now you have all the elements of a Great Question. It's a big goal and it's specific. You're doubling sales, and that's not easy. You also have a time frame of six months, which will be a challenge. 
if "What can I do to double sales in six months?" is a Great Question, how do you make it more powerful? Convert it to the Focusing Question: "What's the ONE Thing I can do to double sales in six months".
- Answers come in three categories: doable, stretch, and possibility.
Doable - The easiest answer you can seek is the one that's already within reach of your knowledge, skills, and experience. With this type of solution you probably already know how to do it and won't have to change much to get it. 
Stretch - You'll most likely have to do some research and study what others have done to come up with this answer. Think of this as potentially achievable and probable, depending on your effort.
- Extraordinary results require a Great Answer. Highly successful people choose to live at the outer limits of achievement. They not only dream of but deeply crave what is beyond their natural grasp.
- A Great Answer is essentially a new answer. It is a leap across all current answers in search of the next one. Anytime you don't know the answer, your answer is to go find your answer.
-  A college professor once told me, "Gary, you're smart, but people have lived before you. You're not the first person to dream big, so you'd be wise to study what others have learned first, and then build your actions on the back of their lessons." 
- The research and experience of others is the best place to start when looking for your answer.
- This is how big problems are solved and big challenges are overcome, for the best answers rarely come from an ordinary process. 

1. Think big and specific. Setting a goal you intend to achieve is
like asking a question. It's a simple step from "I'd like to do
that" to "How do I achieve that?" The best question-and by
default, the best goal-is big and specific: big, because you're after
extraordinary results; specific, to give you something to aim at and to leave
no wiggle room about whether you hit the mark. A big and specific
question, especially in the form of the Focusing Question, helps you zero in
on the best possible answer.
2. Think possibilities. Setting a doable goal is almost like creating a task to
check off your list. A stretch goal is more challenging. It aims you at the
edge of your current abilities; you have to stretch to reach it. The best goal
explores what's possible. When you see people and businesses that have
undergone transformations, this is where they live.


PART3
EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS (UNLOCKING THE POSSIBILITIES WITHIN YOU)3. Live with Purpose
- "Even if you're on the right track, you'll get run over if you just sit there." - Will Roger
- Simple formula for implementing the ONE Thing and achieving extraordinary results: purpose, priority, and productivity. 

13. Live with Purpose
- "Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself." -George Bernard Shaw
- Simple formula for creating an extraordinary life: Live with purpose. Live by priority. Live for productivity.
- Purpose is the straightest path to power and the ultimate source of personal strength-strength of conviction and strength to persevere.
1. Happiness happens on the way to fulfillment. We all want to be happy, but seeking it isn't the best way to find it. The surest path to achieving lasting happiness happens when you make your life about something bigger, when you bring meaning and purpose to your everyday actions.
2. Discover your Big Why. Discover your purpose by asking yourself what drives you. What's the thing that gets you up in the morning and keeps you going when you're tired and worn down? I sometimes refer to this as your "Big Why." It's why you're excited with your life. It's why you're doing what you're doing.
3. Absent an answer, pick a direction. Pick a direction, start marching down that path, and see how you like it. Time brings clarity and if you find you don't like it, you can always change your mind. It's your life


14. Live by Priority
- "Planning is bringing the future into the present so that you can do something about it now." -Alan Lakei
- Live by priority and you'll know what to do to get there..
- The truth about success is that our ability to achieve extraordinary results in the future lies in stringing together powerful moments, one after the other. What you do in any given moment determines what you experience in the next. 
- Hyperbolic discounting-the further away a reward is in the future, the smaller the immediate motivation to achieve it.
- People tend to be overly optimistic about what they can accomplish, and therefore most don't think things all the way through. Researchers call this the "planning fallacy" Visualizing the process-breaking a big goal down into the steps needed to achieve it-helps engage the strategic thinking you need to plan for and achieve extraordinary results. This is why Goal Setting to the Now really works.

1. There can only be ONE. Your most important priority is the ONE Thing you can do right now that will help you achieve what matters most to you. You may have many "priorities," but dig deep and you'll discover there is always one that matters most, your top priority-your ONE Thing.
2. Goal Set to the Now. Knowing your future goal is how you begin. Identifying the steps you need to accomplish along the way keeps your thinking clear while you uncover the right priority you need to accomplish right now
3. Put pen to paper. Write your goals down and keep them close.

15. Live for Productivity
- "Productivity isn't about being a workhorse, keeping busy or burning the midnight oil... . It's more about priorities, planning, and fiercely protecting your time." -Margarita Tartakovsky
- "Efficiency is doing the thing right. Effectiveness is doing the right thing." -Peter Drucker
1. Connect the dots. Extraordinary results become possible when where you want to go is completely aligned with what you do today. Tap into your purpose and allow that clarity to dictate your priorities.With your priorities clear, the only logical course is to go to work.
2. Time block your ONE Thing. The best way to make your ONE Thing happen is to make regular appointments with yourself. Block time early in the day, and block big chunks of it-no less than four hours! Think of it this way: If your time blocking were on trial, would your calendar contain enough evidence to convict you?
3. Protect your time block at all costs. Time blocking works only when your mantra is "Nothing and no one has permission to distract me from my ONE Thing." Unfortunately, your resolve won't keep the world from trying, so be creative when you can be and firm when you must. Your time block is the most important meeting of your day, so whatever it takes to protect it is what you have to do. The people who achieve extraordinary results don't achieve them by working more hours. They achieve them by getting more done in the hours they work.
Time blocking is one thing; productive time blocking is another.


16. The Three Commitments
- "Nobody who ever gave his best regretted it." -George Halas
- THE THREE COMMITMENTS TO YOUR ONE THING
1. Follow the Path of Mastery
2. Move from "E" to "P"
3. Live the Accountability Cycle
- Since there is always another level to learn, mastery actually means you're a master of what you know and an apprentice of what you don't.
- Michelangelo once said, "If the people knew how hard I had to work to gain my mastery, it wouldn't seem wonderful at all." His point is obvious. Time on a task, over time, eventually beats talent every time. 
- Time blocking is essential to mastery.
- "Are you doing this to simply do the best you can do, or are you doing this to do it the best it can be done?" 
- The path of mastering something is the combination of not only doing the best you can do at it, but also doing it the best it can be done. 
- There is an undeniable connection between what you do and what you get.
1. Commit to be your best. Extraordinary results happen only when you give the best you have to become the best you can be at your most important work. This is, in essence, the path to mastery- and because mastery takes time, it takes a commitment to achieve it.
2. Be purposeful about your ONE Thing. Move from "E" to "P." Go on a quest for the models and systems that can take you the farthest. Don't just settle for what comes naturally-be open to new thinking, new skills, and new relationships. If the path of mastery is a commitment to be your best, being purposeful is a commitment to adopt the best possible approach.
3. Take ownership of your outcomes. If extraordinary results are what you want, being a victim won't work. Change occurs only when you're accountable. So stay out of the passenger seat and always choose the driver's side.
4. Find a coach. You'll be hard-pressed to find anyone who achieves extraordinary results without one.
Remember, we're not talking about ordinary results- extraordinary is what we're after. That kind of productivity eludes most, but it doesn't have to. When you time block your most important priority, protect your time block, and then work your time block as effectively as possible, you'll be as productive as you can be. You'll be living the power of The ONE Thing. Now you just have to avoid getting hijacked.

17. The Four Thieves
- "Focus is a matter of deciding what things you're not going to do." -John Carmack
- THE FOUR THIEVES OF PRODUCTIVITY - 1. Inability to Say "No", 2. Fear of Chaos, 3. Poor Health Habits, 4. Environment Doesn't Support Your Goal

INABILITY TO SAY NO
- Someone once told me that one "yes" must be defended over time by 1,000  "nos.". The way to protect what you've said yes to and stay productive is to say no to anyone or anything that could derail you.
- "One-half of knowing what you want is knowing what you must give up before you get it." In the end, the best way to succeed big is to go small. And when you go small, you say no-a lot. 
- Saying yes to everyone is the same as saying yes to nothing.
- Saying yes because you can't bear the short-term pain of saying no is not going to help you do the work.
- Your time is finite. If you don't make your life about what you say yes to, then it will almost certainly become what you intended to say no to.
- "I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everybody."
- When you give your ONE Thing your most emphatic "Yes!" and vigorously say "No!" to the rest, extraordinary results become popossible

THE FEAR OF CHAOS
- Messes are inevitable when you focus on just one thing. While you whittle away on your most important work, the world doesn't sit and wait. It stays on fast forward and things just rack up and stack up while you bear down on a singular priority.
- Focusing on ONE Thing has a guaranteed consequence: other things don't get done. 
- When you strive for greatness, chaos is guaranteed to show up. If you have to beg, then beg. If you have to barter, then barter. If you have to be creative, then be creative. Just don't be a victim of your circumstances. Don't sacrifice your time block on the altar of "I just can't make it work." My mom used to say, "When you argue for your limitations, you get to keep them," but this is one you can't afford. Figure it out. Find a way. Make it hahappen.

POOR HEALTH HABITS
- Personal energy mismanagement is a silent thief of productivity.
- When people don't understand the power of the ONE Thing, they try to do too much.
- They go for success by sacrificing their health. They stay up late, miss meals or eat poorly, and completely ignore exercise. 
- High achievement and extraordinary results require big energy. The trick is learning how to get it and keep it.
- If you haven't spent time with your loved ones at breakfast or durin your workout, go find them. Hug, talk, and laugh. You'll be reminded wh you're working in the first place, and motivated to be as productive as possible so you can get home earlier.
ENVIRONMENT DOESN'T SUPPORT YOUR GOALS
- Your environment must support your goals.
- For you to achieve extraordinary results, the people surrounding you and your physical surroundings must support your goals.
- The people around you may be more important than you think. It's a fact that you're likely to pick up some of the attitudes of others by working with them, socializing with them, or simply being around them. From co-workers to friends to family, if they're generally not positive or fulfilled on the job or away from it, they'll probably pass on some of their negativity. Attitude is contagious; it spreads easily. As strong as you think you are, no one is strong enough to avoid the influence of negativity forever. So, surrounding yourself with the right people is the right thing to do.
- Who you hang out with also has serious implications for your health habits
- If the people you spend your time with are high achievers, their achievements can influence your own. 
- "Surround yourself only with people who are going to lift you higher." -Oprah Winfre
- when you clear the path to success- that's when you consistently get there.
- Don't let your environment lead you astray. Your physical surroundings matter and the people around you matter. 

1. Start saying "no." Always remember that when you say yes to something, you're saying no to everything else. It's the essence of keeping a commitment. Start turning down other request outright or saying, "No, for now" to distractions so that nothing detracts you from getting to your top priority. Learning to say no can and will
liberate you. It's how you'll find the time for your ONE Thing.
2. Accept chaos. Recognize that pursuing your ONE Thing moves other things
to the back burner. Loose ends can feel like snares, creating tangles in your
path. This kind of chaos is unavoidable. Make peace with it. Learn to deal
with it. The success you have accomplishing your ONE Thing will
continually prove you made the right decision.
3. Manage your energy. Don't sacrifice your health by trying to take on too
much. Your body is an amazing machine, but it doesn't come with a
warranty, you can't trade it in, and repairs can be costly. It's important to
manage your energy so you can do what you must do, achieve what you
want to achieve, and live the life you want to live.
4. Take ownership of your environment. Make sure that the people around you
and your physical surroundings support your goals. The right people in your
life and the right physical environment on your daily path will support your
efforts to get to your ONE Thing. When both are in alignment with your
ONE Thing, they will supply the optimism and physical lift you need to
make your ONE Thing happen.
Screenwriter Leo Rosten pulled everything together for us when he said, "I
cannot believe that the purpose of life is to be happy. I think the purpose of life
is to be useful, to be responsible, to be compassionate. It is, above all, to matter,
to count, to stand for something, to have made some difference that you lived at
all." Live with Purpose, Live by Priority, and Live for Productivity. Follow these
three for the same reason you make the three commitments and avoid the four
thieves-because you want to leave your mark. You want your life to matter.

18. The Journey
- "To get through the hardest journey we need take only one step at a time, but we must keep on stepping." -Chinese Proverb
- When you lift the limits of your thinking, you expand the limits of your life.
- Think small and your life's likely to stay small. Think big and your life has a chance to grow big. The choice is yours. When you choose a big life, by default, you'll have to go small to get there. You must survey your choices, narrow your options, line up your priorities, and do what matters most. You must go small. You must find your ONE Thing.
- You have to make it happen.
- "Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go. - T. S. Eliot
- One evening an elder Cherokee told his grandson about a battle that goes on inside all people. He said, "My son, the battle is between two wolves inside us. One is Fear. It carries anxiety, concern, uncertainty, hesitancy, indecision and inaction. The other is Faith. It brings calm, conviction, confidence, enthusiasm, decisiveness, excitement and action." The grandson thought about it for a moment and then meekly asked his grandfather: "Which wolf wins?" The Cherokee replied, "The one you feed.
- It's only when you have faith in your purpose and priorities that you'll seek out your ONE Thing. And once certain you know it, you'll have the personal power necessary to push you through any hesitancy to do it.
- "Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw offthe bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover." -Mark Twain
- Go live your life. Live it fully, without fear. Live with purpose, give it your all, and never give up." Effort is important, for without it you will never succeed at your highest level. Achievement is important, for without it you will never experience your true potential. Pursuing purpose is important, for unless you do, you may never find lasting happiness. Step out on faith that these things are true. Go live a life worth living where, in the end, you'll be able to say, "I'm glad I did," not "I wish I had.".
- What would a life worth living look like.?
- A life worth living might be measured in many ways, but the one way that stands above all others is living a life of no regrets.
- Live your life to minimize the regrets you might have at the end.
- Gilovich and Medvec in 1994 wrote, "When people look back on their lives, it is the things they have not done that generate the greatest regret.... People's actions may be troublesome initially; it is their inactions that plague them most with long-term feelings of regret."
