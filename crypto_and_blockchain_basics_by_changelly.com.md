# Learn crypto & blockchain basics

## CHAPTER 1: Intro: Overview
The history of cryptocurrency and blockchain is intertwined with the history of money. Ironically, the story of money began long before paper banknotes, gold coins, gold bars, or any other items we associate with this word. Let’s start at the very beginning!

Once upon a time…
…one man bought a pizza for 10,000 BTC..

## Bartering
Before the traditional cash system developed, there had been no consistent means of payment. It was the time of dinosaurs bartering.

Bartering means exchanging one’s goods or services in return for another’s. Before cash, bartering was the most common and popular way to obtain anything you might need for life and business.

Let’s take an example to illustrate how it works. Imagine people in funny old-time clothes. If a baker wanted to buy some milk, they would offer the farmer bread in return for it. Thus, two loaves of bread in return for a liter of milk. 

There is a problem with bartering, though. The person you’re purchasing the goods/service from may not need or value what you’re offering. Maybe the farmer already has enough bread and needs something else, like a rope. Maybe they’re gluten intolerant. In any case, the baker is in a bad situation. They have two options now: 

To search for someone who has a rope and wants bread > to trade > to go to the farmer > to trade the rope for milk
To flip the farmer the bird and look for someone else who has milk but needs bread 
It’s like a bad quest in a fantasy game.

Another problem with the bartering system is divisibility. You can’t divide things into smaller parts. If all the farmer has to trade is a cow, and they want grains to grow new crops… What are they to do? They can’t sell a cow’s leg and get a bag of grain, retaining the cow’s initial value. No one needs a three-legged cow. And if the farmer sells their cow whole, they will get ×10 bags of grain, which they don’t have time to plant. Depending on a person’s needs, the value of something small could be greater than something big, like grain and a cow. 

### Commodity money
Over time, bartering was replaced with commodity money. Commodity money is a type of good that functions as a currency. Commodity money has certain characteristics: widely desired, therefore creating value, but also portable, durable, and easily stored. 

Some early examples of commodity monies were animal skin and dried corn. However, these all were later replaced with precious metals, like gold.

In terms of practicality, gold wasn’t particularly useful. You can’t eat it, and it won’t keep you warm when it’s cold. But the majority of people find it beautiful, and they know other people think it’s beautiful too. 

Gold is useless… but it shines so prettily. This metal became valuable because we all agree it has value. Gold’s appearance, relative scarcity, and the difficulty of extraction only added to our perception of it as an expensive item.

### Paper money and coins
However, gold also had problems with divisibility. It is virtually impossible to go to the market with a brick of gold to buy some milk and bread. Because of this, and due to some other problems like weight, came the development of paper money and coins. Many countries have tied the value of their new currencies to gold. The US dollar was one such example.

The gold was held by a national central bank. During the time of the gold standard, this precious metal was used as a guarantee. It guaranteed the country would fulfill its promises and pay depositors, holders of paper money, and trading peers. Like beauty, gold was a promise of happiness and a warranty that the value of the national currency is supported by valuable metals. Some countries stored gold to give value to their paper currency. The US was among them.

The gold standard implies that the entire state’s money supply is backed by gold. In this system, central banks are obliged to guarantee the exchange of banknotes for gold at a fixed rate. At the time of the gold standard, central banks set the exchange rates between different currencies. 

However, history shows that the gold standard doesn’t guarantee price stability.

During the Second World War, the US had many allies paying for military supplies and other materials and goods in gold. So, by the end of the war, the United States had held 75% of the world’s monetary gold reserve, and the dollar had been the only currency still directly backed by it.

Nonetheless, some problems appeared after WWII. As the world rebuilt itself, the US quickly found that they had spent most of their reserves. The scarcity of gold led to problems with the inability to mine enough of it to cope with economic growth. Also, the value of money to gold wasn’t stable anymore. Gold was once again useless.

As a result, the US government decided to stop backing the dollar with gold in 1971. By doing so, they turned the dollar into what’s known as a fiat currency. Now, not one country in the world uses the gold standard.

Fun fact: Great Britain was the first to drop off the gold standard in 1931.

### Fiat currency 
A fiat currency is a government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity. Its value comes from the stability of the government, people’s faith in the government, supply, and demand. 

Most paper currencies around the world are fiat currencies (e.g., the US dollar and the Euro). 

At first, fiat currencies brought calmness and stability to the financial world for a while. However, with the development of technology and payment methods, new problems became more visible in the system. 

### Problems with centralized currency
When each country’s central bank controls how much money is printed and issued, there can be several problems:

inflation (increase in prices); and… 
devaluation (reduction in the value of money).
As a result, small groups of people, mainly people in positions of power and wealth, took full control of most currencies.

Ordinary citizens and the majority of the population don’t have any say in how much money would be printed or when. That means that people’s entire life savings could become worthless just because of mistakes or poor decisions at the government level. And that there is nothing they can do about it. This is one of the principal problems with the centralized cash currency system.

A centralized cash currency system means that the power to control financial decisions in the country lies with a small group of people (e.g., the government or central bank) instead of the majority of the population.

Another common problem with a centralized cash currency system is exchange fees. With the development of credit cards and international money transfers, banks and other third-party intermediaries became involved in the payment process. 

If you use your credit card to pay for something or send funds to another person, the credit card issuer will usually charge a fee for each transaction. The same happens when you use a wire service to transfer money to your family abroad. 

For example, if you are sending money to your brother, and you both have the same bank, there will probably be a small transaction fee as there will be no extra outside parties involved. But if we were to send money to a friend who’s a client of a different bank in some other country, there would be a whole chain of third parties. And the more intermediaries participate in a transaction, the higher the transaction fee will be.

### The Crisis of 2008 
In 2008, the financial crisis shook the entire world economy. Nowadays, people are wondering what has changed since then and how to avoid similar economic turmoil in the future.

This is the year when it has become explicit that a centralized currency system also has a security problem. 

Banks can lose their licenses, go bankrupt, or get hacked, and all the information and money belonging to the customers of such a bank could be stolen and disappear forever. Having a single point of failure makes banks particularly vulnerable. Such dangers became truly visible, with many banks going bankrupt and governments bailing them out with public funds. 

Even the famous Netflix drama Money Heist (La Casa de Papel) is a metaphor for the money-printing moves adopted by major central banks in the West in 2008.

In the US, more than 8 million citizens lost their jobs, approximately 2.5 million businesses went bankrupt, and nearly 4 million homes were foreclosed in less than two years. Many people lost faith in the system due to food insecurity and income differentiation.

But without 2008, cryptocurrency may not be what it is today.

### Bitcoin is born!
In 2008, we saw the release of the Bitcoin whitepaper written by Satoshi Nakamoto. Published on October 31, 2008, the original thesis paper on Bitcoin sets the basic structure of the Bitcoin network.

To this day, it is still not known who Satoshi is. Is it a pseudonym? Is Satoshi one person or a group of people? There are many theories trying to guess this identity, but none have been confirmed. Satoshi outlined the structure for a new global digital currency that could solve all of the above-mentioned problems. The Bitcoin concept was born.

### Bitcoin vs centralized currency 
Bitcoin is a decentralized currency. It uses blockchain technology to create a global network of computers that collectively verifies and protects the network against hacking and transaction forgery. Since the network doesn’t have a single point of failure, like a bank, it’s nearly impossible to break or hack it. In order to even try, hackers would need to take control of millions of computers simultaneously.

Bitcoin has incorporated two of the principal security principles of crypto: transparency and trust.

Transparency in the blockchain industry refers to the ability of anyone to view and verify the data on the blockchain. All transactions and data on the blockchain are publicly available, and anyone can inspect the ledger to ensure that all transactions are valid and legitimate. This is made possible by the decentralized and immutable nature of the blockchain, which allows for a transparent and tamper-proof system. Transparency is a key feature of blockchain technology and is essential for building trust and accountability in various industries.

According to Satoshi Nakamoto, the root problem with conventional currencies lies in all the trust that’s required to make them work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. In crypto, where all processes are automated, the matter of trust is not an issue.

Trust. Since all processes are automated, the participants can be sure that the probability of hacking is minimal. Thus, the trust in each party in the transaction increases. It’s simple: if you aim to buy Bitcoin, you’re very unlikely to get robbed on the way. 

Bitcoin’s total emission is set at 21 million. This amount cannot be changed, and more coins cannot be mined. Due to the system created to mine and find the coins, the last coins are not expected to be mined until the year 2120, thus helping the currency deal with problems of inflation and devaluation. 

Bitcoin transactions are peer-to-peer based and have low fees. In the Bitcoin network, the following types of fees exist:

wire fees
mining fees
account fees
spot fees
tiered transaction fees
Bitcoin is a global currency: you can send it to anyone, anywhere, anytime. Compared to cash, Bitcoin is highly divisible — $1 can be broken down into quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, the smallest amount being worth one-hundredth of a dollar, or 0.01 in numerical terms. The smallest unit of a single Bitcoin is one hundred millionth, or 0.00000001 in numerical terms. The name of this tiny unit is a satoshi, sometimes called sats for short.

### The disappearance of Satoshi Nakamoto
Bitcoin has had quite a rapid growth since its creation. As mentioned, in 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper. On January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the starting block of the chain, known as the genesis block. This was the date when the Bitcoin network was created.

In December 2010, Satoshi mysteriously disappeared. The famous words — 

“I’ve moved on to other things.”

### Satoshi Nakamoto
— were among the last things anyone heard from this deity. Bitcoin started living on its own, without the master. It survived the collapse of one of its biggest markets in the early days, the Silk Road, in 2013. And in 2014, it survived the Mt. Gox scandal. 2015 saw Ethereum, which is commonly viewed now as the second main cryptocurrency, go live. In 2017, we witnessed the ICO boom, and Bitcoin hit a record high of almost $20,000. In 2021, Bitcoin’s price increased by over 300% in a year, soaring to $64,000 — the highest it has ever been so far. In 2022, the crypto winter came and set its rules for the market players up to 2023. 

### Bitcoin now
Many companies have started accepting Bitcoin as a means of payment. At Microsoft, you can pay for Xbox Live and Skype subscriptions. Starbucks lets customers buy drinks and other goods with the Bakkt app. AirBaltic and LOT Polish Airlines both accept Bitcoin payments for flight tickets. PayPal, Home Depot, Etsy… And the list continues to grow.

It’s hard to see the future without the involvement of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Many well-known and respected figures in the world of tech also seem to have faith in it. 

Peter Thiel, the co-founder of PayPal, said, “I do think Bitcoin is the first [encrypted money] that has the potential to do something like change the world.” 

Bill Gates called Bitcoin “a techno tour de force,” and Elon Musk stated, “I am a supporter of Bitcoin.” 

### Other cryptocurrencies
Bitcoin is just the tip of the iceberg. 

There are over 20,000 cryptocurrencies, which resolve different tasks and help solve problems in various spheres. 

The decentralized world is here! Smart contracts help eliminate third parties, reduce transaction fees, and automate processes. Blockchain technology is also used in the medical sphere by companies like MediLedger and FarmaTrust, which help the pharmaceutical sector verify the authenticity of medicines, assess prescriptions, and track and trace any issues in the supply chain. 

Sierra Leone was the first country to use blockchain technology in national elections in early 2018 in order to reduce the chance of corruption and rigged elections. Governments across the world own an estimated 259,870 BTC, representing 1.237% of the total supply. 

What the hell is blockchain? How does it work? Can you enlighten me, but in a way so that I don’t fall asleep? Yep, read on. 






## CHAPTER 2. Blockchain
A very short definition of blockchain would be “an unhackable public ledger,” but it doesn’t explain much.

Imagine blockchain as a pile of boxes with old photos in your garage. Each box represents a year of life. One box is from when you were 5; another is from when you were 10, and so on. You have your parents’ wedding pictures, pictures of your hamster Biscuit, and unflattering images of you on your potty.

Blockchain, too, consists of boxes. They are called “blocks,” thus the name — block-chain. Each block contains information. 

When we fill boxes with photographs, we tape them shut and stack them on top of each other in a pile. However, once we fill blocks with data, we can’t pile them up on the blockchain. They are linked or chained together.

Chained blocks create a linear history of recorded data. This chain of information is the blockchain. As new info comes in, we put it in a fresh block (like a new box of photos). Then, that block gets linked to existing ones. Creating new blocks on the blockchain is a never-ending process. 

Blocks are files where the data is collected together. For example, with Bitcoin, the most recent block contains the most recent transactions. When each block is filled, it is attached to the previous block in the chain, and a new block gets opened to record new data. It is like a page in a record book: each page can be regarded as a block, with the whole book representing the blockchain. 



The concept of blockchain appeared almost 20 years before Bitcoin. It was first outlined in 1991 by Scott Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. These two exceptional researchers wanted to implement a system where document timestamps couldn’t be changed or tampered with. However, it wasn’t until the arrival of Bitcoin in 2009 that this concept got its first real-world application. 

Since 2009, cryptocurrencies and blockchain systems have become best buddies. Literally “inseparable.” This is because cryptocurrency transactions ARE the data stored on a blockchain. 

But where does all this data “live”? Like in a mega-computer or something? In thousands of computers, actually. There is no central place of storage because the blockchain system is decentralized.

### Decentralization
Cryptocurrencies like BTC need an extensive network of computers to store all their data. Nevertheless, the Bitcoin network isn’t held all in one location with a single point of control: it is made up of computers all around the world, each with its own individual and unique operator (miner).

Decentralization spreads power, control, and authority among many locations and/or people instead of locking it up in one place, in the hands of one person or central institution. Because of these characteristics, a decentralized system is more secure, and any attacks on it are less likely to succeed. Yet, such an event is possible. We will talk about it below.

Each machine in this network is called a node. Each node has a full record of all the data stored on the blockchain since its very inception. So, for Bitcoin, it would be the entire history of transactions. 

### How is a transaction processed? Consensus algorithms 
Remember when you did something so embarrassing that you’re still getting flashbacks? The blockchain, too, has an excellent memory for very specific things: it memorizes the time of each piece of data stored on it. When a block is filled, the information it holds is set in stone. 

The blockchain remembers. Each new block adds a “hash,” or a line of code, from the previous block. Since every one of them must be authenticated before it can be added, altering the chain is merely impossible. The data stored in the chain cannot be changed and becomes part of the timeline. 

When it comes to recording transactions on the blockchain, the process is quite simple. For example, this is what happens when you send (let’s imagine) 1 Bitcoin:

After you click “Send,” the transaction becomes a block of information. 
The information is then transmitted across a network of peer-to-peer (P2P) nodes spread around the world. 
Nodes validate the transaction. For Bitcoin, the transaction must be validated through a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. 
Nodes receive a special reward for validating the transaction, usually in cryptocurrency.
A new block containing the transaction is added to the blockchain. 
The transaction is completed! 

So, a node is a server that validates the blocks of data/transactions on the blockchain. 

Peer-to-peer refers to the direct sharing of data, information, or even assets, without the involvement of a third party or a central authority.

A consensus algorithm refers to a method of synchronizing nodes and validating transactions.

Such blockchains as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, and many others utilize the proof-of-work consensus algorithm to create new blocks. 

Proof of Work (PoW) is a type of consensus algorithm used to confirm transactions and produce new blocks on the blockchain. When a transaction is being processed, users check and prove its accuracy by solving a complex mathematical problem. PoW requires a lot of energy, which often gives a person with the most potent set-up the best chance of getting a reward. 

EOS, TRON, and Tezos (and someday, we hope, Ethereum) use a proof-of-stake algorithm. 

Proof of Stake (PoS) is another consensus algorithm. It differs from PoW in that a person, a miner, can validate blocks of transactions based on how many coins they hold. PoS was created as an alternative to PoW as the latter requires massive amounts of energy. Instead of using up energy to solve PoW algorithms, PoS miners are limited to mining the percentage of transactions relative to the number of coins they own. For example, if you own 5% of available coins, you can only mine 5% of blocks. 

If one node has an error in its data, thousands of other nodes can be used as a reference point for correction. This way, no nodes within the network can alter the information held inside. As a result, the history of transactions in each block making up the Bitcoin blockchain is irreversible and reliable. 

Even if someone were to tamper with Bitcoin’s transaction history, all other nodes would cross-reference and easily pinpoint the node with incorrect information. This helps to establish the exact and transparent order of events. It’s like a group of friends. If one friend starts making up rumors and claiming things that aren’t true, the rest of them will eventually come together and confront the liar. 

In order for such an attack to be successful, the person or persons carrying out the hack would need to simultaneously control and alter at least 51% of all copies of the blockchain so that the new copy would be the majority, making it an agreed-upon chain. But since the Bitcoin network is so large and ever-growing, such a feat would be pretty much impossible to complete. Even if it occurred, success wouldn’t be guaranteed. Such changes to the blockchain would definitely be noticeable, and the other network members could just split off or fork off to a new version of the chain that has not been affected. We are going to explain a 51% attack in detail in Chapter 7. Crypto security.

A hack of this level would also cause the value of the attacked version of Bitcoin to drop significantly, ultimately making the whole operation pointless as the hacker would then control a worthless asset. The Bitcoin blockchain is built in such a way that joining and taking part in the network is much more economically beneficial than attacking it. 

### Smart contracts
Most cryptocurrencies either use their own blockchains or borrow blockchains from other platforms. Some smaller alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, use the blockchain technology of bigger ones, like Bitcoin. Others create their own new blockchains to do something different, like Ethereum, which lets developers build and publish smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).

___
Smart contracts are programs stored on the blockchain. Like in paper contracts, parties can write the conditions of their transaction. Those conditions don’t exist in words: instead, they are lines of code. Smart contracts are self-executing, so there is no need for any third parties or intermediaries. 

Decentralized applications, or dApps, are programs that exist and run on a blockchain or a peer-to-peer (P2P) network of computers instead of a single computer.

Smart contracts are built into the blockchain to verify, execute, or negotiate contract agreements. They can be used to automate any workflow once the conditions are met. 

The terms of the agreement are carried out automatically. They follow a simple pattern of “if/when… then…” — for example, if I give you $10, you will give me a book, meaning smart contracts give me a book once I have given you ten bucks. They also help eliminate extra fees and processes usually associated with a third party, a mediator, an attorney, or a notary.

### Is blockchain just about crypto?
Blockchain technology can also be used in a wide range of sectors and industries to record data and procedures. For example, it can trace the journey of food products from their origins to their final destination, noting every stop they make along the way. Each stop is counted as a block in the chain. 

Another industry that could significantly benefit from implementing blockchain technology is the banking and financial sector. Most banks work Monday to Friday, 9 am to 5 pm, and are closed on public holidays, yet the blockchain never sleeps. It is operational 24/7, 365 days a year. 

Since blockchain eliminates many intermediaries and third parties, it could reduce both transaction fees and time frames of banking transactions. 

Blockchain could find another real-world application in voting where it could modernize voting systems, eliminate voter fraud, and boost voter turnout. This was proven in the test in the 2018 midterm elections in West Virginia. Blockchain would make it virtually impossible for votes to be tampered with, help ensure transparency, and provide officials with almost instant results. We are exploring more real-world use cases of blockchain in Chapter 12. Spoiler alert: Hennessy, Louis Vuitton, Nike, and other giant players are using (or going to) use blockchain. 

### Summary time
To sum up, a blockchain is a database that can store all kinds of information. The data is stored in blocks, like small boxes. When each block is filled, it is chained to the previous ones, arranging all of them in linear order. Bitcoin was the first real-world application of blockchain technology, and it is the most well-known. 

Once a block is verified and recorded on the chain, a piece of data inside can no longer be changed or edited.
PoW and PoS consensus algorithms are used to verify and validate transactions.
The decentralized nature of the Bitcoin blockchain helps improve its security by removing a single point of failure/control.
Most cryptocurrencies have their own blockchains, or they borrow the blockchain of another platform.
Blockchain increases transaction speed and eliminates the need for third parties and intermediaries.
Smart contracts execute an agreement once the pre-arranged conditions of that contract are met.
Blockchain isn’t just for cryptocurrencies and recording transactions: it can be used in a wide range of industries, such as supply chains, voting (e.g., blockchain technology implementation in Sierra Leone), etc.





## CHAPTER 3. Types of cryptocurrencies
Today, there are over 20,000 cryptocurrencies. Quite a few! Fun fact: there are only 180 “regular” fiat currencies like the US dollar, euro, etc.

Don’t worry. To become a pro in cryptocurrency, you don’t have to study all of them. It’s enough to master how 7 types of cryptocurrency work to know what to expect and which crypto is the best investment.

### Coins vs Tokens
Many investors who’ve spent years trading fail to learn the basics, like the difference between coins and tokens. The terms may not sound that distinct, but they serve unique purposes.

Tokens don’t have their own blockchains. 
To put it shortly, coins have their own blockchains. Tokens don’t. But that’s not the end. In reality, the difference is much bigger than tokens simply being “homeless” cryptos.

The most famous coins (that are “natives” of their blockchain systems) are BTC and ETH. Crypto tokens are created and work on top of the pre-existing blockchain — for example, USDT. Although they are mostly based on the Ethereum blockchain, some, including USDT, operate different token versions on several blockchains at once.

Tokens have different purposes, whereas coins are exactly what they sound like — just currency. Tokens can: 
represent physical assets (like NFTs)
represent securities (like bonds, stocks, or property)
provide access to utilities or services
represent your rights and power
NFTs are a prominent example of digital assets. Utility tokens — for instance, Basic Attention Token (BAT) and Golem (GNT) — exist to provide their holders with access to goods and services. Governance tokens are a subtype of utility tokens. They grant access to certain decisions offered by a protocol. One of the earliest examples here is MakerDAO.

So, what’re we left with? Crypto coins like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Ripple serve as assets that you can invest in. Plus, they have their blockchains. These blockchains can also “rent” space to other digital assets. Assets that live on borrowed blockchains are called tokens. It doesn’t diminish their value, though: tokens are simply different from coins. 

### Types of Cryptocurrency
Now that you know the difference between a coin and a token, let’s move deeper into the crypto jungle! 

As we mentioned before, there are 7 types of crypto that serve different purposes:

Store-of-value cryptocurrency
Store-of-value cryptos literally “store their value.” These cryptocurrencies are designed to hold or even increase their purchase power over time. 

This also usually leads to an increase in price, but price and purchasing power are very different things.

Purchasing power is the number of goods and services one can purchase with a currency unit. Price is the amount of money someone will pay you when buying your crypto. 

The difference is clearer if we illustrate it with a practical example. 

Let’s go back to traditional cash for a second:

Governments are constantly printing new money. But “more paper” is not the answer. If not followed by an increase in production, money will lose its value and purchasing power. A bag of grain will cost $50 instead of $5. Everything costs more; thus, our money is worthless. 

Imagine you’re a tycoon who just invested in a hotel. You operate your business under a government that prints new money all the time. Over the year, your stocks went up by 3% in value. Is it a good thing? Not really. Everything is now more expensive. You have to pay higher for building materials, catering services, and everything else you need for the hotel, including salaries.

We can see the difference between price and purchasing power in how dramatically the price of everyday products, like bread and milk, has changed over the years. 30 or 40 years ago, they only cost a fraction of what they do today. The reason: the value of our currency has dropped, so we need to spend more to buy the same stuff.

According to estimates released by the Census Bureau, Department of Commerce, the average income of families in 1965 was $6,900 per year. The average family income in 2020 was $68,400. Looks good? Yes, but. It’s a big “but.” In 1970, the average house price was from $22,100 to $25,700. Now, it’s nearly $200,000. 

So, as you can see, the more money the government prints, the more it loses its purchasing power. The same goes for cryptocurrencies. 

Those with unlimited supply lose their purchasing power. This is why paper currencies are not reliable.

What about crypto?

A limited number of coins keeps cryptos from losing purchasing power.

Coins like Bitcoin, which have a limited maximum supply of 21 million, will probably rise over time. 

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, with many other cryptocurrencies relying on it. BTC’s popularity and growing purchasing power put it in the bracket of a store-of-value cryptocurrency. Its limited supply can drive its purchasing power up, higher and higher. 

Litecoin (LTC) is another cryptocurrency we could include in this bracket. It also has a limited supply of coins, although Litecoin’s supply, with a maximum of 84 million coins, is larger than that of Bitcoin.

### What are the pros and cons of store-of-value cryptos?
The main advantage of store-of-value currencies is that they are a safer and more secure investment compared to others. Plus, they are more likely to go up in value over time. However, it depends on whether a particular crypto had a fair launch or not. 

A fair launch is a type of crowdfunding when the community collectively starts mining the cryptocurrency together from the launch. That means the team and private investors kept the majority of that coin’s supply for themselves. 

There is also a disadvantage to the store-of-value currencies: it is the limited functionality of such coins. Some people even refer to Bitcoin as a “pet rock,” suggesting that it does nothing but just sit there. The limited functionality is also why some people don’t believe that Bitcoin will be the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization in the future.

Examples of store-of-value cryptos: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, TrueUSD, Decred. 

Smart contract cryptocurrency
Smart contracts help create tokenized assets and decentralized apps (dApps). As we mentioned before in Chapter 2. Blockchain, they are a system of self-executing code. 

The code carries out a set of instructions, which are then verified on the blockchain. For example, if you agree to sell me a book for $10, a smart contract will help you ‌receive $$$ the moment your customer gets the book. 

Smart contract cryptocurrencies get their value from their use as payment for smart contract and dApp transactions. 

In the banking and financial sector, smart contracts can reduce transaction times and fees by eliminating third parties. Because of its growing popularity, it’s becoming more common for Ether to be accepted even as a means of online payment, with sites such as Overstock, Spotify, and CheapAir now accepting it. 

Smart contracts provide an opportunity to create different cryptocurrency tokens. 

Cryptocurrency tokens can be fungible and non-fungible. Fungible tokens are cryptos like Bitcoin. Non-fungible tokens are data units that represent unique digital assets stored and verified on the blockchain. Non-fungible tokens are often called NFTs.

________________________________________________________________________

Fungible means that a token operates like a regular cryptocurrency, meaning that it is interchangeable and can be easily exchanged. Money is a good example of this: if we lend you $20, it doesn’t matter if we get the same $20 bill back or not. You could pay us with a different one or two $10 bills or a $10 and two $5 bills. We will still get back the value of the money we originally lent you. 

Non-fungible means the opposite: this thing or the item is unique and can’t be replaced with something else. Say, you had Edgar Dega’s Dancers in Blue painting, a complete one-of-a-kind. If you traded it for one of Monet’s paintings or even another Dega, you would be getting something different altogether. In the past few years, we’ve seen the rise of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, which can be a drawing, a piece of music, or even real estate — anything that can be digitized.

________________________________________________________________________

Most non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are supported by the Ethereum blockchain, Ethereum being the most popular smart contract platform. Some other blockchains have implemented their own versions of NFTs. 

These NFTs have extra information stored on the blockchain and work differently than Ethereum’s cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH). NFTs cannot be exchanged or traded at an equivalent rate: as we said, they each have their own value, and one NFT does not equally replace another, even if their monetary value is the same at the time. 

### What are the pros and cons of smart contract cryptos?
Unlike store-of-value cryptocurrencies, many smart contract cryptocurrencies do not have a maximum supply of coins — they have annual inflation schedules instead. 

This leads to the main advantage of smart contract cryptocurrencies. Their value is tied to the size and adoption of the dApp and token ecosystems built on their blockchains. What the hell does that mean? If a smart contract cryptocurrency is heavily supported and adopted, it could have a market cap worth trillions of dollars.

However, the disadvantage here is that we don’t know which smart contract cryptocurrencies will become successful. There is a lot of competition on the market, with new projects constantly popping up. So before picking some crypto and investing money, it is crucial that you do your research. 

Examples of smart contract cryptos: Ethereum, BNB, Cardano, Avalanche, Ethereum Classic.

Oracle cryptocurrency
Oracle cryptos make it possible to bring real-world data to smart contract blockchains. 

Most of the apps we use every day require some kind of external real-world data. For example, the time and date, the weather, or the current price of something we would like to buy or sell. Centralized applications get their information from centralized APIs. 

________________________________________________________________________

API stands for Application Programming Interface. APIs allow two unrelated systems to interact with each other, establishing an online connection between the data provider and the end user. For example, Facebook receives information about the weather in your area from the weather broadcasting network.

Smart contract cryptocurrency blockchains need real-world data for their dApps to have real-world applications and use cases. This data is provided by oracle cryptocurrencies. 

The difference between APIs and oracle cryptocurrencies is that the data feeds of the latter are decentralized. Like smart contract cryptocurrency coins, oracle tokens are also used to pay the fees for getting this data.

### What are the pros and cons of oracle cryptos?
The main advantage of oracle cryptocurrencies is that the demand for their tokens is likely to grow.

The main disadvantage is that a large number of them didn’t have a fair launch. This means that when the price of those tokens rises, there is a huge risk for those team members and private investors to sell, which will prevent the price from going even higher.

The most popular oracle cryptocurrency is Chainlink (LINK), with a current market cap of $3 billion. 

The Arbo company uses Chainlink to receive data about the weather so that it can evaluate weather risks. 
The Theta Network applies Chainlink to receive viewership data to fight online advertising fraud.
Examples of oracle cryptos: Chainlink, Universal Market Access, WINklink, Band Protocol, iExec RLC.

Payment cryptocurrency
Payment cryptocurrencies aim to replace the payment systems we use today. In addition, they sometimes utilize smart contracts. 

We’ve already discussed some of the problems traditional payment systems face, such as excess fees for third parties and a long time ‌to process transactions.

Payment cryptocurrencies make it possible to complete such payments within seconds at a fraction of the cost. 

### What are the pros and cons of payment cryptocurrencies?
The main advantage of payment cryptocurrencies is that they have the highest chance of mainstream adoption, and their target market is the most lucrative. Their main disadvantage, however, is that it is highly unlikely that any of them will replace traditional money anytime soon.

Launched in 2017 as an alternative to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is one of the most well-known payment cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Cash sees consumer payments as more essential to growing its value in the short term, so users find it better suited for online spending.

Examples of payment cryptos: Bitcoin Cash, Tether, USD Coin, Binance USD, XRP.

Privacy cryptocurrency
Despite the advanced and sophisticated level of encryption and privacy offered by pretty much all cryptocurrencies, full anonymity is unlikely to be guaranteed by any. This is because blockchain transactions are recorded and accessible on the public ledger. Your real-world identity can be connected to your wallet, especially if you use an exchange that requires your personal information. 

Privacy cryptocurrencies are designed to preserve your privacy as a primary goal. As with all cryptos, transactions are registered on the open ledger, but this type of crypto helps to make your identity truly anonymous. 

### What are the pros and cons of privacy cryptocurrencies?
The main advantage of privacy cryptocurrencies is that they are… well, really private. They offer complex privacy features and reassure investors that their transactions cannot be linked. The disadvantage of privacy cryptocurrencies is that they are frequently targeted by regulators. Governments claim that they are commonly used for illicit and illegal activities, with some privacy cryptocurrencies being removed from exchanges as a result.

Monero’s (XMR) popularity has been rising, mainly due to its ability to help anonymize users and its focus on private payments. Monero transactions are much more difficult to trace because they use ring signatures and stealth addresses. 

A centralized cash currency system means that the power to control financial decisions in the country lies with a small group of people (e.g., the government or central bank) instead of the majority of the population.

Examples of privacy cryptos: Monero, Zcash, DASH, Horizen, Verge.

Exchange tokens
Exchange tokens are like a mix of membership subscriptions and shares of the company’s stock. They are owned and operated by crypto exchanges and work like a subscription. 

Exchange tokens can give you a whole load of benefits, such as reduced trading fees and VIP access to early coin and token sales. And they are like shares of the company’s stock because the exchange token’s performance depends on the popularity of the platform. The reason is that almost every exchange will do buybacks and burn some of the circulating supply of its exchange tokens using a portion of trading fees.

The buyback boosts the price, and the burn reduces the supply, together with increasing token value over time.

Some exchange platforms, like Binance, have built their smart contract cryptocurrency networks. To use them, you need to exchange their tokens. That adds an aspect of demand for them. 

### What are the pros and cons of exchange cryptocurrencies?
The key advantage of exchange tokens is that they are likely to increase in value. The core disadvantage is that their benefits don’t come as quickly as those of other cryptocurrencies, and sometimes, these gains aren’t even totally guaranteed. 

As these exchanges grow bigger, pressure from regulators intensifies. For example, Telegram’s attempt to develop TON, its own blockchain network, was shut down after a legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

The Binance coin (BNB) is an example of an exchange token. It is used to pay fees (i.e., exchange trading and listing the exchange levels) on different platforms. Benefits, such as a 50% discount on fees, exist as incentives. BNB’s current market cap is just over $70 billion.

Examples of exchange cryptos: Binance Coin, KuCoin Shares, 0x Protocol, Bancor Token.

Meme coins
Meme coins have no specific use or purpose. They are just for fun! Sometimes they can be dangerous, though, as people will try to scam you with them. The most popular meme coins are SHIBA INU (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE). 

If someone said to you, “Hey, give me $200, and I will make you a millionaire,” you would probably tell them to “get lost” and see through this scam. However, when someone says the same bullshit about meme coins, people seem to believe it. 

Some investors regard this type of crypto as an opportunity to buy cheap and sell high: they understand the hype around meme coins will cause them to grow in value. But given the market cap, dollar value, and supply of many of these coins, this increase is unlikely to be very big. 

You should always pay attention to the market cap and maximum supply of meme coins. For example, SHIBA INU has a max supply of one quadrillion tokens, and its market cap is already at $6 billion. For SHIBA INU to reach a value of $1, people need to invest billions and trillions. And that will never happen. 

Most of the other meme coins also have similar massive supplies, meaning they won’t be reaching $1 in value soon either. In Chapters 5, 6, and 7, we will go into greater detail about crypto trading and how to build your portfolio.

### The pros and cons of memes… coins?
These meme coins have no real end game. It’s a big difference between them and other cryptocurrencies. Real coins, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, solve real-world problems and change how we pay for things and how some industries work. 

You can try your luck and invest, but it is not worth the time, effort, and risk. Meme coins are the most manipulated cryptos, and their main purpose is to make their creators rich by tricking innocent investors.

DOGE, however, is a little bit different as it offers merged mining with Litecoin, yet it has a long way to go before any investors can make any real profits, regardless of how many tweets and memes Elon Musk shares about it. 

________________________________________________________________________

Merged mining is an act of mining two or more cryptocurrencies at the same time without sacrificing the overall mining performance. A miner uses their computational power to mine blocks on multiple chains at once by utilizing Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW). All cryptocurrencies involved in merged mining must use the same algorithm. Some suggest that merged mining can help smaller blockchains increase their security by leveraging it against the hashing power of bigger blockchains. However, many developers disagree with this, saying that it just provides a false sense of security.

Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW) ensures that the work done on one chain is valid on another chain. The blockchain that provides PoW is called the parent blockchain, while the one that accepts it is the auxiliary blockchain. Both cryptocurrencies involved must use the same algorithm.

Examples of meme cryptos:
Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Floki Inu, RoboApe Token, Dogelon Mars.

### Summary time
So, to give a brief recap, there are 7 types of cryptocurrencies, each with its own advantages, disadvantages, and uses:

Store-of-value cryptocurrencies hold and increase value over time. In terms of cryptocurrencies, they are relatively safe and stable. However, their limited functionality is sometimes seen as a disadvantage. 
Smart contract cryptocurrencies help create tokenized assets and dApps. They get their value from their use as a payment method for smart contracts and dApp transactions. Ethereum is the most popular smart contract cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $166 billion.
Oracle cryptocurrencies bring real-world data to smart contract blockchains that need this information for their dApps to have real-world applications and use cases. 
Payment cryptocurrencies aim to replace our current payment systems. They have the highest chance of mainstream adoption, and their target market is the most lucrative. However, this is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a well-known example of a payment cryptocurrency.
Privacy cryptocurrencies preserve your privacy when you’re making transactions or using dApps. Generally, they are well-designed and built to last, but they are a common target for regulators. Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC) are two examples of this type of cryptocurrency.
Exchange tokens are owned and operated by the cryptocurrency exchanges they belong to. Binance coin (BNB) is probably the most well-known example of an exchange token.
Meme coins have no actual real-world use or advantage. However, skillful investors can understand in advance which tokens will be hyped up and buy them early to sell them later on at a higher price. Dogecoin is the most famous example of a meme coin.
