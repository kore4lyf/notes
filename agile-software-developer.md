### The History of Agile  
- Agile emerged organically as a result of a market need to deal with the crisis product development faced in the 1990s. 
- Back in the 1990s, it was taking somewhere in the range of 2-4 years to get a software solution to production from the time it was conceived as a valuable business need. 
- This delay was just not acceptable for enterprise business users. The market had started to evolve and it was beginning to be realized that both the needs and expectations from the business users would not remain static for so long.

A growing number of experts felt that there had to be a better way to build products with a focus on:
- business users, and
- business value.


In the Spring of 2000, a group of industry experts gathered in Oregon to come up with some common ground on Agile. 
This meeting led to a famous gathering in Utah in February 2001 where 17 thought leaders finalized The Agile Manifesto. 
This historic gathering set the foundation for all Agile frameworks.

Since Agile was developed for software development, many think that software is the only place where Agile is valuable. However, today Agile is being applied in all industries across the globe.
 
 
 
 
### Agile Tools 
Agile tools are excellent communication and collaboration resources. So, for example, they: 

- Help monitor the teams' progress in a transparent and visible manner
- Can be customized to accommodate Agile teams in various industries with different Agile frameworks 
- Provide real-time dashboards and reports that show the Agile team's progress against the product roadmap

Some Examples of Agile tools
- Jira
- Confluence 
- Slack
- Rally  
- Microsoft Teams
- Trello 
- Kanbanize
- VersionOne

## Why Agile 

### Why Are Organizations Adopting Agile
So, why are forward-thinking organizations rapidly adopting Agile? 

Agile enables organizations to predictably deliver value in a world where we are constantly being challenged with 
i. Volatility
ii. Uncertainty
iii. Complexity
iv. Ambiguity

Organizations that I have seen go through Agile transformation have benefited from the following:

1. Faster time to market 
  - Accelerate product development cycle 
  - Agile teama are able to relase products anywhere from 50-80% faster. 
  
2. Early ROI 
  - Help squeeze cash out if WIP (Work in progress) 
  - Increase project and portfolio returns 

3. Feedback from Real Customers

 

Organizations that go through Agile transformation have also benefited from:
- Build the right products 
- Early risk reduction
- Built-in quality
- Culture and morale 


#### Efficiency vs. Effectiveness 
Efficiency and effectiveness is a fine balancing act that Agile recommends.
If you’re only focused on going fast, you prioritize efficiency.

If you’re trying to focus on innovation, creativity, and making sure you’re working on the right thing, you need to focus on effectiveness.

This is often done at the cost of efficiency.

Agile ensures a balanced approach whereby Agile Teams ensure there is a balance between speed and creativity.

Agile transformations also benefit from:
- Customer Satisfaction
- Alignment
- Emergent Outcomes
- Predictability 

Organizations want to use Agile to get there by developing products better, faster, and cheaper.



### How Experts Approach Agile 
Agile Is Based on a Systems Thinking Approach and a Growth Mindset
- Agilists adopt a practical and realistic approach to delivering the best value, and quality, in the shortest sustainable time.
- A Systems Thinking approach, reinforced by a Growth Mindset, helps Agile experts deliver optimal business value.
- Systems thinking takes a holistic approach in which the Agile Team looks at the way a system's components interrelate and influence each other and how these components come together within the context of larger systems to deliver a solution.
- In a growth mindset, individuals on a team have the mindset that their abilities can grow through dedication and hard work.


> Systems Thinking + Growth Mindset = Optimal Business Value

**Traditional Thinking**: Looks at the parts separately 
**Systems Thinking**: Looks at interdependent and connected components of a system




### The Agile Mindset
What Is the Agile Mindset? 

**Agile permits teams to flourish in an environment that is increasingly Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous, also known as VUCA.**
- Volatility is when there are unexpected or unstable possibilities that may influence the work being done
- Uncertainty refers to the extent to which an organization can confidently predict or forecast the future
- Complexity exists when there are many interconnected parts and variables that influence each other
- Ambiguity refers to a lack of clarity, such as not having a clear understanding of the genuine needs of the customer and end-users

summary: 
Volatility - Unexpected or unstable possibilities 
Uncertainty - Unknown future
Complexity - Interconnected parts 
Ambiguity - Lack of clarity



#### Business Agility
Agile is a set of principles that guide how we as individuals, as teams and as organizations think about, as well as act upon, the work that we do.

Business agility is the ability of an organization to:
- Adapt quickly to market c
- hanges
- Respond rapidly and flexibly to customer demands that make business sense
- Adapt and lead change in a productive and cost-effective manner with no compromise to quality

#### The Agile Mindset
When we talk about an Agile Mindset, we include:
- Respect 
- Collaboration
- Continuous Improvement
- Iterative Learning Cycles
- Mastery and Ownership
- Focus on Delivering Value
- Adaptability to Change


#### Doing Agile vs. Being Agile
Some organizations and Agile Teams unfortunately just focus on Doing Agile. This equates to simply adopting the practices without committing to or exhibiting agile principles and values.

Being Agile is the foundation that truly elevates individuals, teams, and organizations to unleash their latent potential to deliver monumental and focused value.




### The Agile Manifesto 
Up until the late 1990s, a majority of product development followed a waterfall-style project development life cycle that was based on adhering to strict processes.

The whole product procedure was process-centric with the goal of delivering the product successfully rather than focusing on delivering a successful product. This is what lead 17 experts to get together and finalize the Agile Manifesto at a meeting in Utah back in 2001. 


#### The 4 Agile Core Values
These were developed by 17 industry experts and finalized in 2001. They are:

- **Individuals and interactions over processes and tools**: Agile places more importance and emphasis on people and their interactions over processes and even tools.
- **Working software over comprehensive documentation**: Documentation requires a time and resource commitment that might be wasteful.
- **Customer collaboration over contract negotiation**: Agile promotes a collaborative outlook when product owners work with their customers in reaching an agreement on the details of the product delivery.
**Responding to changes over following a plan**: Agile embraces the change that makes business sense.



#### The Agile Manifesto Principles
The Agile Manifesto’s 4 paired core values and its associated 12 guiding principles set a solid foundation for the various Agile Frameworks that are currently being practiced by successful organizations in today’s digital age. 


##### The 12 Agile Principles
The Agile Manifesto’s 4 paired core values drive the 12 Agile Principles. Let's look at the principles in detail.

1. **Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.** The goal of product development is the development of successful products.

2. **Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive aadvantage** Due to the dynamic competitive landscape, requirements can and will change throughout product development. 

3. **Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter time scale.** Frequent and iterative delivery of working products provides the business with practical feedback.

4. **Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.** The Product Owner and the Agile Team adopt practices that ensure inclusive and joint practices.

5. **Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.** Agile leaders build Agile teams with skilled resources who are willing to work together collaboratively with a growth mindset.

6. **The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.** For a product development team to succeed its members must communicate and collaborate effectively.

7. **Working software is the primary measure of progress.** The primary measure of product development should be the delivery of working product increments, which meet the evolving needs of the business.

8. **Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.** A highly skilled team simply just cannot be expected to successfully develop a product by compelling people to work overtime for extended periods.

9. **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.** Built-in quality practices have enormous benefits. It allows for easier maintenance and scalability of the product.

10. **Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.** With the guidance of the Product Owner, Agile Teams focus on high-value activities, which allows them to focus on the high business value needs.

11. **The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.** This is a critical principle of the agile world to ensure that emerging and effective architectures, requirements, and designs are built into the product development life cycle to maximize technical excellence.

12. **At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.** Finding concrete opportunities for improvement is a continual effort.




- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility: it keeps the software maintainable  

- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams: self-organizing teams have a higher level of ownership in the designs they create 

- Business representatives and developers must work together daily throughout the project: it is mandatory for the stakeholders and the team to meet and converse daily 

- Deliver working software frequently: this ensures timely feedback that can be incorporated early in the product development process





### Agile vs. Waterfall
Comparing Agile to the Waterfall Methodology 
#### Waterfall vs. Agile
The waterfall model is a more stringent and process-driven style where the project is broken down into project activities through structured phases, with toll gates established to formally review progress. The focus is on the work to be done and not on delivering functional vertical slices.

Waterfall “fixes” the scope and estimates time & cost. Agile breaks this paradigm because Agile “fixes” time & cost and allows the scope to be flexible.


| | Agile	| Waterfall | 
| :--- |  :--- | :--- | 
| Product Lifecycle |	Iterative	| Distinct phases | 
| Design Process |	Incremental	| Sequential |
| Change |	Change is embraced |	Change is a challenge |
| Mindset/Focus |	Customer needs |	Completing the project |
Collaboration	| Significant collaboration |	Limited Synchronization |
| Requirements |	Prepared incrementally |	Prepared at start of project |
| Organization |	Self-directed team	| Led by Product Manager |


#### The Stacey Diagram
The Stacey Diagram is a popular method to select the appropriate project or product management style.

 - According to the Stacey Diagram, Agile makes sense with Complex projects with some Uncertainty. 
 
 - Projects that have a predictable and straightforward outcome are better managed with Waterfall.

##### Conditions Where Agile May Not Be Helpful:
- Lack of agreement in terms of requirements and process 
- No vision and no clear roadmap
- Near certainty on requirements and process upfront

##### Conditions Where Agile Works Best:
- An environment of complexity and some uncertainty where an adaptive approach is needed
- With complicated requirements that need iterative cycles to understand the needs of end-users




### Misconceptions of Agile

#### Five Common Misconceptions of Agile
Common Misconceptions of Agile
Here are 5 of the more common Agile misconceptions that should be avoided keeping the Agile Mindset in focus:

- **Scheduling Agile ceremonies makes a team Agile** - Holding ceremonies for the sake of holding ceremonies does not deliver benefits. Ceremonies must adhere to the core principles of Agile.
- **The Facilitator role is just like a traditional Project Manager** - The Facilitator role is different from the Project Manager role. A Facilitator should be a Servant Leader who assists with whatever the team needs to forward.
- **Large teams are okay** - Agile recommends small cross-functional teams that allow the team to be nimble and powerful.
- **The product backlog can be managed like a traditional requirements document** - The backlog should not be a process-driven document. It should focus on customer value and strategic objectives.
- **Documentation and audit trails for compliance are not important in Agile** - Agile does not mean no documentation -- it just removes low-value documents and documents what is valuable to maintain and sustain the product.







## Build and Evolve Agile Teams
This lesson will cover the following key topics:

**High Performing Agile Teams**
How Agile Teams are the vehicle that delivers valuable work tied to business-driven product features and functionality.
Characteristics of a high-performing Agile Team.
How to sustain High Performing Teams.

**Size, Structure, and Skills of an Agile Team**
The 3 core roles in Agile.
An Agile Team’s optimal size, structure, and cross-functional skills.

**Agile Governance**
Agile Governance and how Agile governance leverages The Agile Manifesto’s guidelines to balance assurance with adaptability.




### Why Agile Teams?
Why Do Agile Teams Matter?

Agile Teams are a critical vehicle to deliver valuable results because of the following:
**Focus on Value** - Agile is driven by the goal of delivering maximum business value that is aligned with the organization’s vision.
**Self-Organized Teams** - Agile Teams have the autonomy to make some de-centralized decisions, which allows for shared ownership of the work.
**Constructive Conflict Resolution** - Conflicts in Agile Teams are constructively resolved because the team is driven by a shared vision.
**Innovation Hub** - Agile Teams, with diverse and cross-functional skill sets, are an innovation hub that spurs solutions.
**Cultivate Mastery** - Time is put aside in Agile Teams for learning and growth. This allow



### How Experts Approach Agile Teams
Thinking About Agile Teams 

#### Key Points About High Performing Teams
- Agilists believe that nothing is more critical to delivering exceptional products than teamwork.
- Agile Teams live and breathe the "we" mindset rather than “I." 


#### Tuckman Model
The Tuckman Model, which has 5 stages of team development, describes how an Agile team progresses into an awesome Agile squad.

**Forming** - Agile Team comes together and the Facilitator helps the team form by explaining the ground rules, product vision, and expected outcomes.
**Storming** - This is where a team’s velocity is impacted because there tends to be some confusion and ambiguity around the work to be done, roles, and other product-related questions.
**Norming** - Agile Team members develop a sense of trust and camaraderie. There’s a healthy rapport and each team member starts to look for the collective objectives of the team’s long-term success.
**Performing** - Once an Agile Team has successfully worked together over a few iterations they should be in a state where they have gelled together and developed a strong cross-functional work style.
**Adjourning** - If the business leaders realize that a product is not delivering value or is no longer needed in the market, the existing Agile Team members can be re-allocated to other more valuable work in the organization.



### Three Core Roles
What Are the Three Core Roles? 

Three Core roles in Agile Frameworks: Product Owner, Facilitator, and Agile Team
- A Product Owner, often referred to as PO in short, is responsible for working with both The Agile Team as well as the business to maximize the value of the product deliverables being worked on. The Product Owner is primarily responsible for prioritizing and managing the Product Backlog, or the prioritized work item list.

- Agile Teams are self-directed and self-organized. The Agile Team members are the ones who accomplish the actual work of completing and delivering a potentially shippable version of the product at the end of each Iteration.


#### Agile Team Members Exhibit T-Shaped Skills
When Agile Team members exhibit T-Shaped skills:
  - They have tremendous expertise in at least one area.
  - They are also capable of providing value in other areas outside their expertise.
  - Team members are able to do role blending by going beyond their core vertical skill set.



#### Facilitator As Servant Leader
To Serve and supporting

The Facilitator is responsible for ensuring the Agile Team moves along at an acceptable pace. The Facilitator is also usually an Agile Coach who promotes Agile practices and values.

##### Facilitators are Servant Leaders Who Serve and Support
Servant Leadership adopts a leadership viewpoint in which the leader positions himself or herself to serve and support. Servant Leadership includes:

- Active listening
- Respect
- Positive attitude
- Neutralize personal biases

Servant Leadership Helps the Team Deliver Results 
Servant Leadership also includes:

- Trust Agile Team’s competencies
- Raise relevant questions
- Shares power and control

Servant Leadership helps a Facilitator build a high-performing Agile team, which in turn enables the Facilitator to truly help the Agile Team achieve results that positively deliver business value.




### High Performing Agile Teams
What Is a High Performing Agile Team?

High Performing Agile Teams have the following in common.
They are:

- Independent and self-directed
- Small, T-shaped teams
- Focused on the mission
- Supported by executives

Moreover, Agile Teams make decisions on their own. They also develop team norms and ground rules, which are useful for guiding group behavior towards a common purpose.



#### Building a High Performing Agile Team
Let’s look at how we can build a high performing Agile Team:

- Inspire the Agile Team.
- Build a Cross-functional Diverse Team.
- Maintain Focus as Team Evolves.
- Encourage Innovation and Free Thinking.
- Communicate Clearly.
- Work Collaboratively to Solve Problems.
- Timebox Meetings.
- Recognize and Appreciate.
- Include Uncommitted Objectives.
- Take Time Out to Connect and Have Fun.


#### High Performing Agile Teams Never Disappoint
According to the American author Dan Pink, a high performing team is given purpose, an opportunity to develop mastery, as well as autonomy in decisions. Such a high-performing Agile Team never disappoints. Such Agile Teams deliver phenomenal results consistently, regardless of the challenges they encounter. Senior leaders in an organization can turbocharge an Agile Team by enabling them to be self-directed and independent.


#### Remote Agile Teams
In an increasingly interconnected global business landscape, High Performing Agile Teams have to identify issues and benefits related to organizing and managing remote Agile Teams. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has genuinely changed the landscape with remote Agile Teams being accepted as a valuable norm. 


#### Implementing Remote Agile Teams
Working with a remote Agile team successfully requires attention to the following:

- Team communication.
- Time Zone Differences.
- Work From Home Best Practices.
- Catch-Ups.
- Lack of Team Cohesion.
Remote Agile teams are definitely here to stay for the foreseeable future. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a sea change in terms of the acceptance of the value of remote teams.





### Organizing an Optimal Agile Team and Non-Core Roles
What Are Size, Structure, and Cross-functional Skills in an Agile Team? 

#### Optimal Agile Team has Between 5-12 Members
- An Agile Team size of less than 5 would make it difficult to have all the competencies needed to do all the work within this one team since an Agile Team should be a cross-functional and multi-disciplinary unit tackling a common goal.
- An Agile Team larger than 12 skilled resources will make it difficult to self-direct and self-organize. As the number of team members increases, the number of communication channels also increases.

#### Clarity and Respect for Core Roles is Critical
Role clarity is an important prerequisite.

Agilists have to remind Agile organizations of the core roles and their responsibilities:

- Product Owner- Voice of the Customer(VOC) and Product Champion
- Facilitator- A Servant Leader
- Agile Team- Responsible for determining how to get the work done that the PO has prioritized

Cross-functional Agile teams are best run as small self-directed teams of 5-12 skilled resources.

> More Communication Channels = More Noise 



#### Non-Core Roles
- While Non-Core Roles are not defined as mandatory in all Agile Frameworks, they can play a key role in the success of Agile Product Delivery.

- Stakeholders - Stakeholders can include Customers, Users, Sponsors, and others who have an interest in the product being worked on, but are not involved in the day-to-day development of the solution results.

- Vendors and Strategic Suppliers - Vendors and Strategic Partners provide products and services that are usually not within the core competencies of the organization or Agile Team.

- Center of Excellence (CoE) - Many organizations have a Center of Excellence focused on either Project or Product Delivery. A CoE often provides guidance on Governance and Reporting requirements to executives and regulators.

- Enterprise Architect - Reviews technical solutions to ensure they align with the overall organization's architecture.

- Domain Subject Matter Expert - Provides valuable support to the PO and Business Analyst on domain knowledge. 

A successful Agile Team is typically both influenced and supported by several key Non-Core Roles.

Coaching Models
Dreyfus Model of Skill Acquisition
The Dreyfus model presents a simple-to-understand framework for measuring an individual’s progress in any skill they are looking to acquire and gain expertise in. The five developmental stages identified in the Dreyfus Model for Skill Development are:

Novice
Advanced Beginner
Competent
Proficient
Expert
Read more about the Dreyfus Model of skill acquisition: The Five-Stage Model of Adult Skill Acquisition 


#### Shu Ha Ri
Shu Ha Ri has its origins in Japanese Martial Arts. It is presented by experts as a way of thinking when learning a new skill. Alistair Cockburn is credited with introducing it in the Agile world when it comes to acquiring Agile skills for product development. There are three stages in Shu Ha Ri’s knowledge acquisition model:

- **Shu**: Here the Agile team member mimics and follows the teachings of an expert.
- **Ha**: At the Ha stage, team members start to experiment and begin to dig deeper into the theory that is driving the expert’s teachings
- **Ri**: When someone reaches the Ri stage, they have directly experimented and experienced how teaching is beneficial to the Agile team’s maturity. This allows them to get creative and adapt to their unique circumstances and organizational context.
You can read more about Shu Ha Ri here:



### Agile Governance 

#### What Is Agile Governance?
Effective Agile Governance is about Making Decisions
In order to enable effective Agile governance, the following needs to be kept in mind:

- Tolerances Are Essential For Agile Governance.
- Decentralized Decision Making Empowers The Team.
- Agile Governance Delivers Goodwill and Trust.
- Agile Promotes Light and Simple Governance.
- Strategic and Long-Term Decisions Remain Centralized.

Effective Agile governance ensures decisions are made in a simpler and lighter manner per the Agile Manifesto’s guidance to keep things simple. 




### What Kills High Performing Teams 
Pitfalls That High Performing Teams Should Avoid
What Kills High-Performance Teams? 

Pitfall #1: Conflicts are not managed effectively; it is important to regularly remind the Agile Team of the value of respectfully discussing differing opinions and suggestions.

Pitfall #2: Blame game begins; there needs to be a tolerance for some failures since Agile Teams work in fast-paced situations. Such blame games and negative criticism quickly escalate to unhealthy conflict. The smarter and healthier outlook is to continue to keep the Agile Team on a learning mindset. 

Pitfall#3: Rules of Engagement are not followed; the Facilitator must ensure the Agile Team honors the agreed-upon rules of engagement and that team communications are frequent and relevant to avoid a high performing Agile Team from commencing its decline.

Pitfall #4: Spark or passion is dimmed; if the Agile Team starts to perceive that their work is not as valuable, it can annihilate motivation. When the product vision starts to get foggy, the Product Owner needs to quickly step in to clarify.





## Agile Framework 

## Why Agile Frameworks?
Why Do Agile Frameworks Matter?
Agile Frameworks Are A Vehicle for Practically Utilizing Agile
Agile's principles related to simplicity, adaptability, and the ability to embrace change attract attention. For Agile to practically be utilized effectively, an Agile Framework, or a combination of frameworks, is usually adopted.

Similarities Between Agile Frameworks:
- Adhere to the Agile Mindset as being fundamental to the success of any Agile journey
- Emphasize that being Agile is critical to successfully doing Agile.
- The Agile Manifesto’s 4 paired core values and its associated 12 guiding principles set the foundation for all Agile Frameworks.
- Provide guidance on how to bring the Agile Manifesto’s core values and principles to life.


Scrum - can be used to balance priorities.
Kanban - used to manage flow and WIP 
XP - 


While each Agile Framework has certain unique characteristics, they all adhere to iterative development and continuous feedback when creating a value-driven product. Agile Frameworks recommend creating and delivering solutions in small increments. 



### How Experts Approach Agile Frameworks 
Thinking About Agile Frameworks

Agile Frameworks are Enablers that Bring to Fruition the Value of Agile

This includes:

- Focusing more on the individuals and interactions; ultimate determining factor for the success of a product are the resources on the Agile product delivery team.

- Do not force Agile unnecessarily; Teams that are already performing well can be gradually introduced to additional Agile practices based on a specific Agile Framework.

- Refined user stories are important; Agilists work with Product Owners to ensure the user stories have been sufficiently refined for the Agile Team to proceed.

- Respect the backlog; Agilists focus on ensuring the Agile Team does not over-commit to what can be accomplished in each iteration, especially during the first few iterations.



##### Implementing a Specific Agile Framework is a Fine Balancing Act
Must adapt based on each organization’s unique culture and context.
Experts have to regularly remind both leaders and the Agile Team to remember that there is no one way to execute Agile practices in an organization.
Agile principles and practices are by their very nature to be adapted as needed.



### Agile Frameworks
What Are Agile Frameworks?
Agile is an Umbrella Term for a Variety of Frameworks that Align with The Agile Manifesto
Every Agile team's goal is to deliver value-driven functionality with built-in quality and to do it quickly. This is where Fail Fast and Learn is priceless. Agile teams who wish to deliver both amazing product features that delight customers, as well as do it fast, must learn to quickly change course when it is realized that a product feature is heading down the wrong path.

#### The Agile Umbrella
The Agile Umbrella has some key characteristics:

- Deliver Value: An absolutely key driver behind anything Agile is to deliver value.
- Continual Improvement: Agile promotes incremental improvement to minimize resistance from all who are involved.
- Flexibility: Flexibility is one of the foundations of any Agile Framework.
- Trust and Respect: Agile Frameworks promote trust and respect because such trust and respect motivate Agile teams.
Cultivate Mastery: This built-in structure for Agile team members to hone their skills further motivates the Agile team.



### Scrum
#### What Is Scrum?
**Scrum Framework**
Scrum is by far the most common Agile Framework.
- The features are delivered in iterations known as Sprints.
- The Team conducts Daily Stand-Ups in which they provide updates to each other.
- Retrospectives are conducted to identify opportunities for improvement at the end of each Sprint.
- Specific roles, as well as certain Ceremonies, are recommended in the Scrum Framework.

**Scrum Pillars**
- **Transparency** - Transparency builds trust and openness both within the Agile Team, as well as with those stakeholders outside the Agile Team.
- **Inspection** - Inspection involves the business users reviewing the Agile Team’s progress towards the defined goals.
- **Adaptation** - Agile Teams adjust and adapt based on opportunities for improvement that are identified either by the Agile Team themselves or through feedback from others outside the team


**Scrum Values** 
5 Scrum Values
- **Focus** - Everyone in the Team focuses on the work to be completed in order to deliver the Sprint goals.
- **Courage** - Members of the Team need to have the courage to do what is right to ensure the Sprint goals are met.
Openness - The Team and its stakeholders agree to a culture of openness.
- **Commitment** - Commitments build trust within the Agile Team members, as well as with the business users and leaders.
- Respect - Respect is a key in Scrum for a high-achieving Agile Team.


**When Scrum Does Not Make Sense** 
As shown in the Stacey diagram, an Agile Framework like Scrum works best with complex and complicated projects and products. There may not be much value in utilizing Agile principles

- when there is a near certainty in both the requirements and process upfront.
- when there is chaos. Scrum cannot bring value to an environment where there is no vision or clear roadmap.
- when the project is simple and predictable and the need for iterative learning and adapting is of no value.




### Scrum Ceremonies and Roles
**Scrum Ceremonies, Project Vision, Daily Stand Up, and Sprint Planning**

**Scrum Ceremonies**
Scrum Ceremonies are focused meetings with a specific purpose. The recommended Scrum Ceremonies are:

- Project Vision
- Daily Stand Up
- Sprint Planning
- Sprint Review/Demo
- Sprint Retrospective
- Release Planning


#### Project Vision
- Project Vision Ceremony is where the business leaders identify the business need the project’s product deliverable is intended to achieve.
- Agenda - Discuss the project goals, identify the sponsor, and outline the project vision, success criteria, assumptions, constraints, and risks.
- Project Vision occurs once per project and is scheduled before the project launch.
- Scrum recommends this ceremony be time-boxed to 1 hour.
Outcome - Business leaders create a desired future state statement.


#### Daily Stand Up or Scrum
- The Daily Stand Up is used to synchronize activities and create a short-term plan for the next 24 hours.
- It is time-boxed to 15 minutes and is held every day, throughout the whole scrum ceremonies, ideally at the same time daily.
- Three questions are addressed by each Team member briefly:
  - What did I do since the last time we met?
  - What do I plan to accomplish today?
  - What impediments am I encountering?
- This is a very valuable Ceremony in which all Team members get an opportunity to report issues they are facing; cultivates transparency across the product development journey. 


#### Sprint Planning
- The Team self-organizes and plans out the work to be performed in the Sprint.
- The work is prioritized by the Product Owner.
- Time-boxed to not more than eight hours for a one-month Sprint.
- Agile Team works with the PO and Scrum Master to address the following three questions:
  a. What are we committing to deliver in the upcoming Sprint?
  b. How will we complete the work required to achieve this commitment?
  c. What are the respective estimates for each user story and associated tasks?
- The Agile Team takes the prioritized backlog items and collaborates on how to carry out the work.

Notes: the Daily Stand Up or Scrum is held daily, including the time between Sprint Planning and Sprint Review.



#### Sprint Review/Demo, Retrospective, and Release Planning
##### Sprint Review/Demo
- The purpose is to generate feedback and nurture collaboration.
- The Team demonstrates the Sprint’s incremental work to the PO and other business representatives.
- The Team and PO transparently discuss accomplishments, as well as opportunities for improvement.
- The PO determines if the Sprint deliverables are acceptable based on the Acceptance Criteria and Definition of Done.
- Occurs once at the end of each Sprint with a time-box of 4 hours for a one-month Sprint. 


##### Sprint Retrospective
- The Team self-inspects its performance during the Sprint and identifies practical opportunities for improvement for subsequent Sprints.
- Retrospectives are held after the Sprint Review; time-boxed to 3 hours for a one-month Sprint.
- The Team also discusses what went well, as well as what to continue to doing that is working very well for the Agile Team in terms of delivering value.

##### Release Planning
- The Team develops a Release Plan that defines when a collection of functionality will be delivered to the customer base.
- The agenda is to discuss critical dates and milestones, coordinate with dependent departments and systems, and balance business value vs quality.
- Only occurs when there is a Release; time-boxed to 20 minutes.


#### Scrum Roles
Similar to other Agile Frameworks, there are 3 core roles in the Scrum Framework.

- Product Owner, who is the voice of the customer.
- Scrum Master, who is the key facilitator.
- Agile Team, also known as the Scrum Team sometimes.

#### Scrum Artifacts
- **Product Increment** clarifies what is being delivered in each increment at the end of each Sprint.
- The **Product Backlog** is the prioritized list of work to be delivered by the Team. The Backlog items are dynamic and evolving based on emergent needs of the business and customer demand.
- The **Sprint Backlog** contains the prioritized items that the PO has designated for the Sprint.

There are other useful information radiators that are commonly used by Agile teams to track and share progress. These information radiators include Burndown Charts, Burnup Charts, and Velocity Charts.







### Kanban
What is Kanban? 

**Kanban Framework**
Kanban has its origins in lean product development, an approach to product development inspired by lean manufacturing principles and practices at Toyota.

**Lean Principles**
Lean product development focuses on 7 fundamental principles:

- Eliminate Waste - Anything that does not add value to the customer.
- Build in Quality - Lean focuses on good practices to ensure integrity and prevent defects.
- Create Knowledge - Lean encourages both training and peer-to-peer knowledge transfer.
- Defer Commitment - Lean recommends the Agile Team wait until the "last responsible moment" to make a decision, which allows for additional time to innovate.
- Deliver Fast - Lean encourages the Agile Team to create and deliver the product incrementally.
- Respect People - The Team must feel trusted and valuable to think and solve problems for themselves.
- Optimize the Whole - Lean encourages decreasing barriers to increase efficiencies by decreasing the amount of hand-offs and reducing WIP.




**Five Principles of Kanban**
Kanban is a lightweight Agile Framework with 5 principles:

- Visualize the Flow - The Team visualizes the workflow, which helps in organizing, tracking, and optimizing the work.
- Limit Work in Progress- Limiting WIP helps to smooth the flow of work, reduce lead times, improve quality and delivery more frequently.
- Manage Flow - By Monitoring and measuring the flow of work, issues are identified as soon as possible, which improves delivery predictability.
- Make Policies Explicit - Establishing policies provides the Agile Team with explicit understanding of the processes for discussions around issues.
-Improve Collaboratively - The Agile Team must own the team’s work related processes and work collaboratively to improve the processes being utilized.

> A Kanban Board plays a valuable role as an information radiator since it shows the work items in their various stages of the product development journey.


#### Kanban Ceremonies, Core Roles and Artifacts 
Kanban Ceremonies
You will recall the 6 Scrum Ceremonies. In Kanban:

- The Ceremonies are simplified.
- There is no Sprint Planning Ceremony.
- And there is no Sprint Retrospective.
- Sprint Review/Demo is just called Review Demo.

So, the 4 Kanban ceremonies align with 4 of the Scrum ceremonies.
- Product Vision
- Daily Stand Up 
- Review/Demo 
- Release timing

**Where Does Kanban Make Sense?**
- Since it focuses on the Agile Team’s workflow and throughput, Kanban is seen as a better Agile Framework option solution for projects where the work is likely to involve a large quantity of relatively small activities.
- Kanban is also suitable for work that may arise on an ad-hoc basis.


**Kanban Roles and Artifacts**
Core Roles in Kanban
- Product Owner - Seen as the voice of the customer.
- Facilitator - Team's Servant Leader.
- Agile Team - These are the resources that collaborate and work on the product deliverables.

**Kanban Artifacts**
- Kanban Board - A Kanban Board plays a valuable role since it articulates the work items in their various stages of the product development journey.
- Cumulative Flow Diagram - A Cumulative Flow Diagram shows the total amount of WIP and how quickly projects are being completed. 



### XP
XP Values

*XP Framework*
Extreme Programming, also known as XP, is a powerful Agile Framework with its roots in software development. XP has a strong focus on technical excellence and best practices in software development.

XP Values
There are 5 XP Core Values. They are



**XP Practices**
The 5 XP core values discussed earlier set the tone for XP’s 13 core practices.

**13 Core Practices**
- Whole Team - The Whole Team practice encourages the entire XP team to be collocated when practically possible. Collaboration tools can be leveraged to follow the Whole Team practice for Remote Teams.
- Planning Games - XP encourages creative approaches to planning. The two formal planning ceremonies in XP are Release Planning and Iteration Planning.
- Small Releases - Small and frequent releases are encouraged in XP at both the iteration, as well as release level.
- Customer Tests - In the Customer Tests practice, the PO works with the customer to describe one or more test criteria as part of defining the requested functionality. The team then ideally builds automated tests to confirm that the developed product’s acceptance criteria are met. 
- Collective Code Ownership - No single developer owns a piece of work. This strengthens the product with a broader knowledge of the code across the team.
- Code Standards - Everyone in the team codes to a consistent standard in XP.
- Sustainable Pace - A consistently high level of productivity can only be maintained at a sustainable pace.
- Metaphor - It is important to adhere to a set of easy-to-remember standard naming conventions for items such as variable names, class names, and methods to facilitate communication.
- Continuous Integration - Software builds are regularly integrated by combining all the coding components together to verify that it compiles and works as a collective codebase.
- Test-Driven Development - In TDD, the team writes the acceptance test before the actual coding is done.
- Refactoring - The Team works to improve existing code to keep the design cleaner to maintain and develop new functionality on top of the existing codebase.
- Simple Design - The optimal design is the simplest one that works.
- Pair Programming - XP advises team members to work on product deliverables in pairs; data shows that this produces higher quality code and costs less in the long run.
- 
The XP Framework has a more stringent approach than many other Agile Frameworks. For example, Kanban is a lighter framework with room for flexibility.


#### XP Core Role and Ceremonies 
XP Roles
XP has a much more stringent approach than many other Agile Frameworks. None of the practices are optional, and it is strongly oriented to software development.

The XP Framework has 4 core roles, 3 of which are quite analogous to the 3 core roles in most Agile Frameworks:

- Customer - Somewhat like the PO; the customer is the business representative.
- Tester - Primarily responsible for quality assurance.
- Coach - Acts as a mentor for the team; also a Facilitator for the team.
- Programmers - Developers who build the product


**XP Ceremonies and Artifacts**
All XP ceremonies align with the Scrum Framework ceremonies discussed earlier. The names are a little different for some of the ceremonies.

**XP Ceremony Names**
- Iteration Planning
- Iteration Review
- Iteration Retrospective
- Project Vision
- Daily Stand Up
- Release Planning


**XP Artifacts**
Since XP is a more thorough Agile Framework in terms of processes, all the artifacts covered in the Scrum Framework and Kanban Framework are included in XP.

- Product Increment
- Product Backlog
- Iteration Backlog
- Burndown Chart 
- Velocity Chart
- Cumulative Flow Diagram
- XP Ceremonies are the same ceremonies as the ones in the Kanban framework 


### Key Differences Between XP and Kanban
In this exercise, you were asked to identify key differences between Kanban and XP.

**Core Roles**
Kanban Core Roles:
- PO
- Facilitator
Agile Team

XP Core Roles:
- Customer, which is somewhat like the PO in Kanban.
- Tester, which does not explicitly exist as a separate role in Kanban.
- Coach, who is somewhat similar to the Facilitator role in Kanban.
- Programmers, which is most closely related to the Agile Team role in Kanban.


**Ceremonies**
XP has two ceremonies, which do not need to take place in Kanban.

- **Iteration Retrospective**, where there’s an opportunity for the Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements.
- **Iteration Planning**, where the work to be performed in the iteration is planned.

XP is more stringent. XP has 13 detailed practices whereas Kanban just focuses on flow and WIP. 




### XP Doesn't Work For Every Team

Challenges with XP
While many organizations get excited when they read that XP brings in rigor alongside the typical benefits of Agile, Agile teams often encounter challenges with XP:

- XP is software-centric - XP places emphasis on software development practices, unlike many other Agile Frameworks in which the emphasis is more on streamlining processes.

- XP Coaches are Tough to Recruit - Recruiting experienced XP coaches is a challenge. XP coaches are expected to be familiar with software development, as well as have the right personality and temperament to facilitate ceremonies and difficult conversations.

- XP is Complex - XP is complex to implement and often feels anti-Agile to some organizations and their leaders. With 13 defined practices, XP has considerably more practices than many other Agile Frameworks.

Organizations who are thinking of XP need experienced XP Coaches, a willing and highly skilled team of programmers, and leaders who have the resilience to guide the organization through the initial transformation.
