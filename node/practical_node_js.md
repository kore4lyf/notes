# Practical Node JS br Azat Mardan
Just to give you some idea, Practical Node.js is a one-stop place for getting started with Express.js 4, Hapi.js, DerbyJS, Mongoskin, Mongoose, Everyauth, Mocha, Jade, Socket.IO, TravisCI, Heroku, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and many others. Most of these items are vital for any serious project.

Practical Node.js takes you from an overview of JavaScript and Node.js basics, installing all the necessary modules to  writing and deploying web applications, and everything in between. We cover libraries including, but not limited to, 

Express.js 4 and Hapi.js frameworks, Mongoskin and the Mongoose object-relational mapping (ORM) library for the 
MongoDB database, Jade and Handlebars template engines, OAuth and Everyauth libraries for OAuth integrations, 
the Mocha testing framework and Expect test-driven development/behavior-driven development language, and the Socket.IO and DerbyJS libraries for WebSocket real-time communication.

In the deployment chapters (10 and 11), the book covers how to use Git and deploy to Heroku, as well as examples of how to deploy to AWS, daemonize apps, and use Nginx, Varnish Cache, Upstart, init.d, and the forever module. 
The hands-on approach of this book walks you through iterating on the Blog project in addition to many other 
smaller examples. You’ll build database scripts, representational state transfer (RESTful) application programming interfaces (APIs), tests, and full-stack apps all from scratch. You’ll also discover how to write your own Node.js modules and publish them on NPM.

**Practical Node.js will show you how to do the following:**
- Build web apps with Express.js 4, MongoDB, and the Jade template engine
- Use various features of Jade and Handlebars
- Manipulate data from the MongoDB console
- Use the Mongoskin and Mongoose ORM libraries for MongoDB
- Build REST API servers with Express.js 4 and Hapi.js
- Test Node.js web services with Mocha, Expect, and TravisCI
- Use token and session-based authentication
- Implement a third-party (Twitter) OAuth strategy with Everyauth
- Build WebSocket apps using Socket.IO and DerbyJS libraries
- Prepare code for production with Redis, Node.js domains, and the cluster library using tips and best practices
- Deploy apps to Heroku using Git
- Install necessary Node.js components on an AWS instance
- Configure Nginx, Upstart, Varnish, and other tools on an AWS instance
- Write your own Node.js module and publish it on NPM
You already know what Node.js is; now, learn what you can do with it and how far you can take it.
