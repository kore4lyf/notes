# React JS
Pure React by Dave	Ceddia




## Introduction
There’s	React, Redux, Webpack, Babel, React Router,	and	on and on.	

**Pure React**:	The	core concepts of React,	in	isolation, without	Redux, Webpack, and the rest.

When you learn React  cold , you’ll be able to go on and learn all of its friends with ease: Redux, Router, and the rest

- We’ll look at how to compose components together and how to work with JSX, React’s HTML-like syntax for rendering elements to the page.
- You’ll learn about “props” as a way to pass in the data they need, and “propTypes” for documenting and debugging the props that a component requires.
- We’ll cover React’s special “children” prop, which is a powerful tool for building reusable, composable components.
- Finally, you’ll learn about “state,” how it differs from props, and how to
organize it in an application. 



### Why Just React?
Without a solid understanding of React, simultaneously learning libraries like Redux and tools like Webpack will only slow down your learning process. It’s very tempting to dive in and learn it all at once, especially if you have a fun project in mind (or a deadline to meet).

Learn Webpack + Babel + Redux + Routing + AJAX later.



### Environment Setup
Tools
- Node.js (at least v4.0, >= 6 recommended)
- NPM (version >= 3 recommended) or yarn
- Google Chrome (or some other modern browser)
- React Developer Tools 
The React Developer Tools can be installed from here: https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools
Follow the instructions to install the tools for your browser. The React dev tools allow you to inspect the React component tree (as opposed to the DOM tree) and view the props and state assigned to each component. It is extremely useful for debugging.

- Your text editor or IDE of choice



### Install Create React App
Run this command to install the tool globally (the -g means global):
```sh
npm install -g create-react-app
```
