## 1. Introduction - Unit testing Mocha Chai

Mocha is a JavaScript test framework on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun.

Installing Mocha

```sh
npm install --global mocha
```

Chai is a BDD/TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any JavaScript testing framework.

BDD - Behavioral Driven Development
TDD - Test Driven Development

## 2. Installation and Writing Test suites and Test cases and Running Test cases (describes, it)

```sh
npm i typescript mocha chai @types/mocha @types/chai ts-node
```

`@types/moch`a & `@types/chai` are needed because we are using typescript.

`ts-node` - ts-node is a typescript execution engine for nodejs. It allows you to run your typescript code without directly precompiling your typescript code to javascript.
