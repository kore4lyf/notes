# Blockchain & Money 

## Section 1:  Introduction 
**Cryptography** - Communication in the presences of adversaries.

**Blockchain** - Timestamped append only log. 
- Refuces the cost of trust.
- It is secured via Cryptography.
- It uses Hash function for Tamper Resistance and Integrity.
- Uses digital signature for consent.
- Uses concensus for agreement (a.k.a concensus protocol) (How do you decide who appends the next block).
Concensus protocol addresss "cost of trust" (a.k.a Byzantine Generals Problem)
    - Permissioned
    - Permissionless
- 

Satoshi did not invent the Blockchain, it has been existing since 1990. 

**Assignment : **
- Find the longest running Blockchain (it's not Bitcoin).


**Solution : **
- Contrary to the belief of many, Bitcoin is not the oldest blockchain. Its place in the history of money and money is that it is the first blockchain to transfer value peer-to-peer without the aid or participation of any intermediary.
- Blockchain technology was invented by the cryptographers **Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta in 1991** not for the purpose of transferring value but as a way to timestamp digital documents to verify their authenticity.


### Study Questions:
- What is Blockchain and why might it be a catalyst for change in the financial sector. 

 

### The Internet Cryptography protocols
- Can Bitcoin Be called a new internet protocol.
- SSL/TLS - 1996 - Paypal
- HTTP - 1990 - Amazon 
- TCP/IP - 1974 - Cisco
- Ethernet - 1974 - 


### Failed Cryptographic Digital Currency
- Digi Cash (David Chaim) 1989
- Mondex (National Westminster Bank) 1993
-  Cybercash (Lynch, Melton, Crocker & Wilson) 1994

### Blockchain Technology
- Verifiably moves data on a decentralised network.
- The data can represent data or computer code (Smart Contract)
- Broad adoption relies on addressing technical, commercial and public policy hurdles.

- Clearing and settlement cost &, counterparty risks
- Financial inclusion

- Payment system costs: 1/2 - 1% of Global GDP
- Financial sector costs: 7(1/2)% of U.S GDP


### Financial Sector Issues with Blockchain Technology 
- Performance, Scalability & Efficiency
- Privacy & Security
- Interoperability
- Governance
- Commercial use cases
- Public policy Issues

### Financial Sector Favours
1. Permissioned Blockchains
- Known set of participants
- No proof-of-work or mining
- No need for a native currency
- Distributed database technology

2. Permissionless Blockchains
- Unknown participants
- Security based on incentives
- Native Currency
- Crypto-economics


### Financial Sector Potential Uses Cases 
- Payment Systems - Cross norder, Lage Interbank & Retail
- Central Bank Digital Currency & Private Stable Sector Value tokens.
- Secondary Market Trading - Crypto exchanges and Custody.

- Stable - Limited Supply - Hard to Counterfeit 


### Early Cryptographic Digital Money


### Digital & Mobile Payments

#### Why did Early Dogital Currencies Fail?
- Merchant adoption
- Centralisation
