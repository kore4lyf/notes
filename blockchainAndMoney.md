# Blockchain & Money 

## Section 1:  Introduction 
**Cryptography** - Communication in the presences of adversaries.

**Blockchain** - Timestamped append only log. 
- It is secured via Cryptography
- It uses Hash function for Tamper Resistance and Integrity.
- Uses digital signature for consent.
- Uses concensus for agreement (a.k.a concensus protocol) (How do you decide who appends the next block).
Concensus protocol addresss "cost of trust" (a.k.a Byzantine Generals Problem)
    - Permissioned
    - Permissionless
- 

Satoshi did not invent the Blockchain, it has been existing since 1990. 

**Assignment : **
- Find the longest running Blockchain (it's not Bitcoin).


**Solution : **
- Contrary to the belief of many, Bitcoin is not the oldest blockchain. Its place in the history of money and money is that it is the first blockchain to transfer value peer-to-peer without the aid or participation of any intermediary.
- Blockchain technology was invented by the cryptographers **Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta in 1991** not for the purpose of transferring value but as a way to timestamp digital documents to verify their authenticity.
