# Blockchain and Cryptocyrrency explained by simplilearn

Bank transactions can fail in may ways and it could be due to
- Technical Issues
- Account Hacked
- Exceeding tranfer limits
- High transfer charges

This lead to the concept of Cryptocurrencies.
Crytocurrency is a form of digital or virtual currency that runs on a technology called blockchain.  

> With the help of blockchain, cryptocurrencies are immune to counterfeiting

> ... cryptocurrencies don't require a control autority

> ... cryptocurrencies are protected by strong and complex algorithms.

In cryptocurrency, when a transaction is made, a record is created in form of a block. The block(record) contains the transaction and the transaction details (the record also holds the number of cryptocurrency that the two users have after the transaction).
Each records or blocks are linked to each other for reference. This chain of records or blocks is called a **Ledger**.
This ledger is shared among all the people on the network, which is know as a publicly distributed Ledger.
When a user tries to make an illigal transcation it will be flaged as illegal, because other users have a copy of the ledger..
A hacker will not be able to alter the data in the block chain because: 
- Each user has a copy of the ledger.
- The data within the blocks are encrypted.

> All this is made possible with the help of blockchain 

## Blockchain 
Blockchain is a collection of records, linked with each other that is strongly resistant to alteration and protected using cryptography. 

> A block is like a page is a record book

> Blockchain is type of database(kinda database upgrade), it is a distributed ledger 

## Bitcoin transaction
Every user in the bitcoin network has two keys
- Public Key 
- Private Key 

The **public key** is an address that is known to everyone in the network eg like an email address
The **private key** is an address that that is uniqe toba single user.
...

User1 wants to send money to User2's. The money is sent alongs with their address using a hashing algorthm. Each hashing algorithm.
All of these are part of the transaction detail. These details are encrypted using hashing algorithms and using User1's private key. This is done to **digitally sign** the transaction and to show that the transaction is from User1.

The output is then sent across the internet using User2's public key. The transaction can then be decrypted only by User2's private key.

## Different cryptocurrencies use differrent Hashing algorithms
BITCOIN -> SHA256
ETHEREUM -> ETHASH

## Transactions 
Transactions are validated and added block by block. The people that validates the block are called miners.
To validate a block, a miner needs to solve a complex mathematical problem. The process of solving this problem os called **Proof Of Work**. The process of adding the block to thw blockchain is called **mining**.

## USAGE
- **WALMART** - 
Problem: High customer return due to delevery of bad producy.

They were unable to determine the point of failure from
FARM - STORAGE - TRANSPORTATION - PROCESSING - DISTRIBUTION CENTER

With Blockchain the quality the product is recorded at each step, which makes it easy to trace the stage the prpduct gpt damaged.


THE CRYPTO IN CRYPTOCURRENCY MEANS CRYPTOGRAPHY
- This involves using encrypting and decrypting data


> Due to the blockchain technology, every transaction is confirmed for its validity and goes into a block; then each block will join to the previously validated blocks, then eventually they all will form a chain of blocks, that we call blockchain. Every bitcoin citizen is required to keep a copy of the blockchain, after each block that gets created by the system, every blockchain member receives a finalized sealed block.
