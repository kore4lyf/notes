# C Sharp 

## Write your first C# code  
### Hello World 
```cs 
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); 
```
R - Hello World  

### Commenting your code 
```cs 
//Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); 
```

### Writting to Console 
Add a new line after printed text. 
`Console.WriteLine` appends a new line after the output.
```cs 
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); 
``` 

Doesn't add a new line after print 
```cs 
Console.Write("Hello World!"); 
``` 


### How Your Code Works 
```cs
Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
``` 

- When the phrase is surrounded by double-quotation marks in your C# code, it's called a **literal string**. In other words, you literally wanted the characters H, e, l, l, o, and so on, sent to the output.

- The Console part is called a class. 

- Classes "own" methods; or you could say that methods live inside of a class. 

- There's also a dot (or period) that separates the class name Console and the method name WriteLine(). The period is the member access operator. In other words, the dot is how you "navigate" from the class to one of its methods.

- The WriteLine() part is called a method. You can always spot a method because it has a set of parentheses after it.


- The parentheses are known as the method invocation operator.

- Finally, the semicolon is the end of statement operator.
