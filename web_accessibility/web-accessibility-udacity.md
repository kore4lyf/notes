# Web Accessiblity - Udacity

##  Accessiblity overview 
 Because web accessiblity is large we'd be referring to WCAG 2.0 (Web content accessibility guidelines) 

**WCAG** - is a set of guidelines and best practices, Which have been put together by accessiblity experts to try and answer the question of what accessibility really means.  

WCAG is organised around 4 core principles 
POUR 

1. Perceivable - this ensures thatusers can perceive content. Just because a content is perceivable woth one sense such as seight doesn't mean that all users can perceive it.

2. Operable - is it operable, can users use UI components, and navigate the content e.g. Something that requires using a hover reaction cannot be achieved by someone who isn't using a mouse and a touch screen. 

3. Understandable - Can all users understand the interface and is it consists enough to avoid confusion.

4. Robust - is the content robust enough to be consumed by a wide variety of people.



> The webaim check list is a compressed version of WCAG. 

### The remaining parts of the course is organised into 
- **Focus** - Focusing keyboard, making sure that we build things that is operable by the keyboard. 
- **operable** - Making ymsure that the UI is being expressed in a robust way that work with a variety of assistive technology.
- **Styling & Visual design** - Ensure the UI is as flexible and usable as possible.



## Focus 
WebAIM checklist items: 
2.1.1: http://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc2.1.1


### What is tab focus
Move focus around the page using your keyboard:

- TAB will move focus forward
- SHIFT - TAB will move focus backwards
- Arrow keys can be used to navigate inside of a component

(Focus Management)[https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#focus-management)


Operable
Interface forms, controls, and navigation are operable. 

Guideline 2.1
Make all functionality available from a keyboard. 

2.1.1 Keyboard
A 2.0
All page functionality is available using the keyboard, unless the functionality cannot be accomplished in any known way using a keyboard (e.g., free hand drawing).
Page-specified shortcut keys and accesskeys (accesskey should typically be avoided) do not conflict with existing browser and screen reader shortcuts. 

2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap
A 2.0
Keyboard focus is never locked or trapped at one particular page element. The user can navigate to and from all navigable page elements using only a keyboard 

2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exception)
AAA 2.0
All page functionality is available using the keyboard.

2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts
A 2.1
If a keyboard shortcut uses printable character keys, then the user must be able to disable the key command, change the defined key to a non-printable key (Ctrl, Alt, etc.), or only activate the shortcut when an associated interface component or button is focused.



### DOM Order Matters 
The tab order corresponds to the DoM order. 

WebAIM checklist items: 
1.3.2: http://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist#sc1.3.sc2


1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence
A 2.0
The reading and navigation order (determined by code order) is logical and intuitive. 




### Using Tabindex 


#### Deciding whats in focus 
Only use Tabindex on interactive elements. We should typically only add tabindex attributes to interactive elements, and not to our site content. 


### Managing Focus

You can skip ahead to Lesson 6 to learn how to change or remove the focus ring from an element. In this case, since we're managing focus and headers are typically not interactive it's probably OK to remove their focus ring. However, you should never remove the focus indicator from an interactive element unless you're going to replace it with something else. Otherwise a keyboard user might have no idea which element is currently focused!

You can manage the focus of a page with a A large nav links by settings a tab-index = -1 on it's header and using JavaScript to focus on the element.
 
#### Linking within a page
Text heavy sites often interlink within the same page to help users quickly jump to important sections.

```html 
<!-- Table of Contents -->
<a href="#recipes">Recipes</a>
<a href="#ingredients">Ingredients</a>

<!-- Recipes Section -->
<h2 id="recipes">Recipes</h1>
<h3>Vegemite Cheesecake</h3>
<p>
    Vegemite cheesecake is delicious. We promise.
    <a href="cheesecake.html">Read More</a>
</p> 
```
 
 
### Skip links 
Skip links are invisible anchors which can only be reached via the keyboard. They allow users to â€œskip" navigation elements in order to jump straight into the content of a page and they can be extremely beneficial for keyboard and switch device users. 

Without some sort of system for bypassing the long list of links, some users are at a huge disadvantage. Consider users with no arm movement, who use computers by tapping their heads on a switch or that use a stick in their mouth to press keyboard keys. Requiring users to perform any action perhaps 100s of times before reaching the main content is simply unacceptable.

The idea is simple enough: provide a link at the top of the page that, when activated, jumps the user to the beginning of the main content area. 


The link is the first item in the page. The anchor or target for the link (where the link will jump the user to) is the main content region.

```html
<body>
<a href="#maincontent">Skip to main content</a>
...
<main id="maincontent">
<h1>Heading</h1>
<p>This is the first paragraph</p> 
``` 

The target is identified by its id attribute value matching the href value (minus the "#") of the skip link. When the skip link is activated, keyboard focus will go to the `<main>` element. Navigation and reading will proceed from this location in the page.


#### Which wording is best?
There are multiple ways that the skip link could be worded:

- Skip navigation
- Skip main navigation
- Skip navigation links
- Skip to main content
- Skip to content 

Any of these may be sufficient so long as the purpose of the link is clearly described. In general, we prefer "Skip to main content" as it explains where the user is navigating to versus what they are navigating past.

#### Multiple skip links are usually unnecessary
What if a page has multiple sections or multiple levels of navigational links? Should developers provide a skip navigation link to each of these sections or to skip over each level of navigational?

In most cases, a single skip link is sufficient.



### Offscreen Content 
To prevent Offscreen content from being focused, set it's `display to none` or `visibility to hidden` 

#### Hiding elements
There may be times when a user will be focused on an item that needs to be set to `visibility: hiddbe` or `display: none`. An example of this would be clickable items within a carousel. 



### Modals and Keyboard Traps 

- 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap - A 2.0
  - Keyboard focus is never locked or trapped at one particular page element. The user can navigate to and from all navigable page elements using only a keyboard. 





##  Visual Considerations 

### Color Contrast

#### WebAIM
To check color contrast online, use the WebAIM contrast checker.
[WebAIM color checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

#### Chrome DevTools
Did you know the Chrome DevTools come with a built-in accessibility color checker?

DevTools color checker


####  Colors and forms
An important consideration for colorblind users is making sure that color isn't the only way users can tell if there is an error with the form. For example, a red ring is not enough. Consider adding an icon or an error label. 


- 1.4.1 Use of Color (Level A)
  - Color is not used as the sole method of conveying content or distinguishing visual elenments. 
  - Color alone is not used to distinguish links from surrounding text unless the contrast ratio between the link and the surrounding text is at least 3:1 and an additional distinction (e.g., it becomes underlined) is provided when the link is hovered over and receives focus.

- 1.4.2 Audio Control (Level A)
  - Mechanism is provided to stop, pause, mute, or adjust volume for audio that automatically plays on a page for more than 3 seconds.

- 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)
  - Text and images of text have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
  - Large text - at least 18 point (typically 24px) or 14 point (typically 18.66px) and bold - has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.


#### Visual Impairments
To simulate a number of visual impairments on any website, check out **NoCoffee** for Firefox

##### NoCoffee simulator
Proximity of notifications from what you're doing
Helps neurological and also low vision (another curb cut example)

##### Setting the language
Remember to set the lang attribute both on the top level html tag as well as any sections where the language deviates from it.

- 3.1.1 Language of Page (Level A) - 
  - The language of the page is identified using the HTML lang attribute (e.g., `<html lang="en'>`).

- 3.1.2 | Language of Parts (Level AA)
  - The language of page content that is in a different language is identified using the lang attribute (e.g.. `<blockquote lang="es">`).

- 3.1.3 Unusual Words (Level AAA) 
  - Words that may be ambiguous, unfamiliar, or used in a very specific way are defined through adjacent text, a definition list, a glossary, or other suitable method. 

- 3.1.4 Abbreviations (Level AAA) 
  - The meaning of an unfamiliar abbreviation is provided by expanding it the first time it is used, using the `<abbr>` element, or linking to a definition or glossary. 

- 3.1.5 Reading Level (Level AAA)
  - More understandable alternative is provided for content that is more advanced than can be reasonably read by a person with roughly 9 years of primary education.



#### Fix markup errors
Although it won't always have a user facing effect, it is recommended that you find and fix and validation or parsing errors in your HTML.

- 4.1.1 Parsing (Level A) 
  - Significant HTML validation/parsing errors are avoided. Check at http://validator.w3.org 
  
- 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
  - Markup is used in a way that facilitates accessibility. This includes following the HTML specifications and using forms, form labels, frame titles, etc. appropriately. 
  - ARIA is used appropriately to enhance accessibility when HTML not sufficient.



#### Neurocognitive

##### Prefers Reduced Motion
Users can set a "prefers reduced motion" setting in their operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux) and we can read that setting in CSS and swap out animations with more subtle effects.

This is important both as a preference and also to avoid causing issues for users who may suffer from seizures.

- 2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold (Level A)
  - No page content flashes more than 3 times per second unless that flashing content is sufficiently small and the flashes are of low contrast and do not contain too much red. (See general flash and red flash thresholds).

- 2.3.2 Three Flashes (Level AAA) 
  - No page content flashes more than 3 times per second.

- 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions (WCAG 2.1 Level AAA)
  - Users can disable non-essential animation and movement that is triggered by user interaction.


```html
<div class="animation">animated box</div>
``` 

```css
.animation {
  animation: pulse 1s linear infinite both;
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion) {
  .animation {
    animation-name: dissolve;
  }
} 
``` 


#### Prefers Color Scheme
Another amazing API is one that allows us to detect if the user prefers a "light" or "dark" colorscheme.

```html 
<div class="wrapper">
  ...
</div> 
```
```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  .wrapper {
    background: black;
  }
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  .wrapper {
    background: white;
  }
}
```



#### Using Media Query in JavaScript 
Supporting darkmode Finding out if dark mode is supported by the browser As dark mode is reported through a media query, you can easily check if the current browser supports dark mode by checking if the media query prefers-color-scheme matches at all. Note ow don't include any value, but purely check if the mnedia query alone matches. 

```js 
// check support for dark mode 
if (window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme)').media !== 'not all') {
  console. log('* Dark mode is supported'):
} 

// Check whether current color scheme is light 
const currentlyLightTheme = window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: light)") 
// returns true if system prefer light color scheme
```
