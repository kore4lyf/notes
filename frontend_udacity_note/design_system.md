# Design System

- A Design System is the complete set of design standards, documentation, and principles along with the toolkit (UI patterns and code components) to achieve those standards.

- Design Systems are essentially collections of rules, constraints, and principles, implemented in the design or code.

- Design System is everything that makes up your product, from typography, layouts and grids, colors, icons, components and coding conventions, to voice and tone, style- guide and documentation, a design system brings all these together in a way that allows your entire team to learn, build and grow. - css-tricks.com

The primary purpose of design systems is to increase efficiency in product development. With a consistent design language in place, it becomes easier to design products at scale that are consistent in aesthetics, user interface, and user experience. Design systems also promote collaboration, since handoffs across distributed teams become easier.

## Why Companies Need Design Systems
- Design doesn’t scale easily. 
- Every new hire increases the design entropy. There’s only one way to stop the growth of the chaos. 
- Committing to running a design system process. Gradual growth of a design system equals gradual increase in consistency and speed of software development.
