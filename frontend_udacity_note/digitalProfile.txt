# Digital Profile

- So, at the very least, you obviously want to have a professional digital profile, in terms of having an updated LinkedIn profile, personal websites, so on and so forth.

- The more you update your profiles, Google will increase your rankings, and your most up-to-date information will come up at the top!

- Recruiters google you when they see your resume.

- 70% of recruiters look you up on social networking sites, while 66% look you up on Google.

- Your comments, images and posts matters, because they are looking for information that supports your qualifications.

- They are also looking for information they can use to eliminate you.
They are looking for someone with a profile that stands out.
Providing less or little information online will not really help you.
