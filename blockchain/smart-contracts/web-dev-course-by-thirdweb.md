# Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are programs that can be created and deployed on a blockchain, which makes it possible to access utilities on the blockchain.

Smart contracts unlock the utility aspect of the blockchain.

Smart contracts are contract, contracts are legal binding documents between two parties agreeing to do something.
In real world contracts, there is usually a third party that is involved or a notory, which will ensure the legitimacy of the contract and also enforce any issue that may arise from the contract.

The benefit of using smart contracts is that it eleminates the need for that third party. Everything written in the smart contract can be self executing through the blockchain. (As long as the requirement of the contract are met, the contract executes itself).

Contracts on the Ethereum blockchian are immutable when deployed.

**Contract Signers**: The signers of the contract, these signers are represented by digital signatures. Which is usually signed and authorised by a wallet.

Smart contracts are fully transparent, any can view the contracts, to see if there is any for malicious code, before interacting with it.

**Smart Contract Auditors**: Smart contract auditor goes through a smart contract to see that every thing is written correctly and there is no malicious activity that can be done correctly. They also approve valid smart contracts.

## Smart Contracts

Which NFT contract should you choose.

ERC20 - A standard that defines how to create fungible tokens, which are interchangeable with other tokens in their category.

ERC721 - Is a standard for NFT contracts. You can create NFTs with this smart contract, each token generaten from the smart contract, is it's own unique token.

A standard that defines how to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which have unique properties that make them different from other tokens in their collection. 

ERC1155 - It combine the standard of ERC20 and ERC721 aka semi-fungible token. Just like ERC721 you can create unique tokens, and (ERC20) you can create multiple quantities of that unique token.

A standard that allows a single contract to track multiple EIP-20 and/or EIP-721 tokens.
