## Intro 
### What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is just a computer program. You can download it and run it on your computer.

When you run the program, it will connect to other computers who are also running this program, and they will start sharing a file with you. This file is called the blockchain, and it is basically a big list of transactions.


When a new transaction enters the network, it gets relayed from computer to computer until everyone has a copy of the transaction. At roughly 10 minute intervals, a random computer (node) on the network will add the latest transactions they have received on to the blockchain, and share the updates with everyone else on the network.
As a result, the Bitcoin program creates a large network of computers that communicate with each other to share a file and update it with new transactions.



### What problem does Bitcoin solve?
It was possible to relay transactions across a network of computers before Bitcoin. However, the problem is that you can insert conflicting transactions in to a network of computers. For example, you could create two separate transactions that spend the same digital coin, and send both of these transactions in to the network at the same time.

This is known as a “double-spend”.
